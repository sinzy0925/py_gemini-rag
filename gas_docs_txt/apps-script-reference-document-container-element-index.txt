A ContainerElement is a generic element that can hold other elements, and various elements like Paragraph inherit from it.
ContainerElement provides methods to cast the element into specific types such as Body, Equation, Table, and Paragraph.
You can find elements and text within a ContainerElement using methods like
findElement()
and
findText()
.
Methods are available to manage child elements, such as getting a child by index, getting the number of children, and getting the child index of a specific element.
ContainerElement includes methods for modifying the element itself, like clearing contents, copying, merging with siblings, removing from parent, and replacing text.
