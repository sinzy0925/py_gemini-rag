Google Drive
File
objects in
DriveApp
allow programmatic interaction with files.
The documentation lists various methods for managing file permissions, getting file information, and manipulating file content.
Specific methods exist for managing access, retrieving details like ID and name, and performing operations like copying or moving files.
Shortcut-specific methods provide information about the target of a shortcut file.
Scripts interacting with files require appropriate Google Drive authorization scopes.
File

Drive
App
