The Base service provides access to user information and controls script logs and dialog boxes in Google Workspace applications.
The service includes classes for handling data interchange (Blob, BlobSource), user interface elements (Browser, Button, ButtonSet, Menu, PromptResponse, Ui), logging (Logger, console), date and time (Month, Weekday), colors (ColorType, RgbColor), user session information (Session, User), and MIME types (MimeType).
Several classes, like Browser and Ui, offer methods for displaying various types of dialog boxes and user interface elements.
The Logger and console classes allow developers to write messages to execution logs and Google Cloud Logging for debugging and monitoring.
