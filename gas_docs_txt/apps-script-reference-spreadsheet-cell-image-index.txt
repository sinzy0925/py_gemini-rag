SpreadsheetApp.newCellImage()
and
CellImageBuilder
.
CellImage has a
valueType
property which is always
ValueType.IMAGE
.
Key methods include retrieving alt text (
getAltTextDescription
,
getAltTextTitle
), getting a Google-hosted content URL (
getContentUrl
), and creating a builder based on current properties (
toBuilder
).
The
