ListItem is a question type in Google Forms allowing respondents to select one choice from a drop-down list.
You can create and access ListItem objects from a Form object using
FormApp.openById()
and
form.addListItem()
.
ListItem objects have methods to create choices, set choice values, get and set the title and help text, and determine if the question is required.
Feedback for correct and incorrect answers can be set for ListItem questions.
ListItem objects can be duplicated using the
duplicate()
method.
