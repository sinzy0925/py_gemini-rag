TextStyle defines the rendered style of text in a cell and can have a corresponding RichTextValue.
If a RichTextValue spans multiple text runs with different style values, a method attempting to read that style will return
null
.
To avoid getting
null
when querying text styles, use the RichTextValue.getRuns() method.
TextStyle provides methods to retrieve font properties like family, size, color, and boolean states for bold, italic, strikethrough, and underline.
The getForegroundColor() method is deprecated and has been replaced by getForegroundColorObject().
