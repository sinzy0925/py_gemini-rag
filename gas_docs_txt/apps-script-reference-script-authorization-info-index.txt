AuthorizationInfo checks if a user has granted authorization for required script scopes and provides an authorization URL to grant those permissions.
The AuthorizationInfo object allows you to control access to code sections requiring certain scopes and request authorization for subsequent executions.
AuthorizationInfo is returned by
ScriptApp.getAuthorizationInfo(authMode)
, with
ScriptApp.AuthMode.FULL
being the generally recommended authorization mode.
Key methods of AuthorizationInfo include
getAuthorizationStatus()
,
getAuthorizationUrl()
, and
getAuthorizedScopes()
.
Authorization
Info
An object that checks if the user has granted authorization for the required scopes of the
script. The object also provides an authorization URL for users to grant those permissions.
Some script executions can start without a user's consent to all required scopes used by the
script. The information in this object lets you control access to sections of code that require
certain scopes and request authorization of those scopes for subsequent executions.
This object is returned by
Script
App.getAuthorizationInfo(authMode)
. In almost
all cases, scripts should call
Script
App.getAuthorizationInfo(ScriptApp.AuthMode.FULL)
,
since no other authorization mode requires that users grant authorization.
