The Card Service enables building card-based user interfaces for Google Workspace add-ons and Google Chat apps across desktop and mobile platforms.
Numerous classes are provided for interactive elements, layout, input and display widgets, response handling, data sources, and styling.
The service includes builders to construct complex UI components and enumerations for various property options.
Methods are available to configure properties, behaviors, and responses for UI elements.
Specific classes and methods are detailed for creating and managing different parts of the user interface, such as sections, cards, carousels, and responses.
Card Service
This service allows scripts to configure and build card and widget components
and behaviors for a UI. The UI structures you build with this service are
automatically available in both desktop and mobile devices, so you don't
need to develop separate UIs for both.
