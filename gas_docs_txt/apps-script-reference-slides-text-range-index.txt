A TextRange is a segment of text within a Shape or TableCell.
Using methods that edit how text fits within a shape will deactivate any autofit settings applied to that shape.
TextRange provides various methods for manipulating text, including appending, clearing, finding, getting information about, inserting, replacing, selecting, and setting text content.
Methods like
asRenderedString()
and
asString()
allow retrieving the text in different formats, including rendered text and raw text with special characters for non-text elements.
Several methods require specific authorization scopes, such as
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations.currentonly
or
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations
.
Text
Range
A segment of the text contents of a
Shape
or a
Table

If you use methods that edit how the text fits within a shape, any autofit settings applied to
the shape are deactivated.
