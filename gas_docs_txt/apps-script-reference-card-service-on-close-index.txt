OnClose is an enum used to specify what happens when a URL opened via OpenLink is closed.
Its behavior can depend on the client platform and may take precedence over OpenAs.
You access an OnClose enum value by calling its parent class, name, and property, such as
CardService.OnClose.RELOAD
.
Available properties include NOTHING (default) and RELOAD, which reloads the add-on on close.
