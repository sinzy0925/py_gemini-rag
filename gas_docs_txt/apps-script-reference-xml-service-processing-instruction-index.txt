ProcessingInstruction represents an XML ProcessingInstruction node.
It includes methods to detach the node, get its raw data, retrieve its parent element, get its target, and get its text value.

The
getData()
method returns the raw data of the instructions within the node as a string.
The
getParentElement()
method returns the parent Element node or null if no parent exists.
The
getTarget()
method returns the target of the ProcessingInstruction node as a string.
The
getValue()
method returns the combined text value of all direct and indirect child nodes as a string.
