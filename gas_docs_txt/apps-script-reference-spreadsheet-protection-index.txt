AI-generated Key Takeaways
outlined_flag
Protected ranges can cover static or named ranges, and protected sheets can have unprotected areas.
You can manage editors for protected ranges and sheets, adding or removing them by email address or User object.
Protection can be removed entirely from ranges or sheets if the user has edit permission.
Descriptions and warning-only settings can be applied and checked for protected areas.
You can retrieve information about protected areas, such as the range, type (RANGE or SHEET), and editors.
Protection
Access and modify protected ranges and sheets. A protected range can protect either a static
range of cells or a named range. A protected sheet may include unprotected regions. For
spreadsheets created with the older version of Google Sheets, use the
Page
Protection
class instead.
