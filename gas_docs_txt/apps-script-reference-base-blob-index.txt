A Blob is a data interchange object used in Apps Script services.
Blobs have methods for copying, converting, and retrieving data in various formats.
You can get and set the byte data, content type, and name of a Blob.
There are methods to handle data as strings with specified encoding and check if the Blob is a Google Workspace file.

Detailed documentation
copy
Blob()
Returns a copy of this blob.
Return
Blob
— The new copy.
get
As(contentType)
Return the data inside this object as a blob converted to the specified content type. This
method adds the appropriate extension to the filename—for example, "myfile.pdf". However, it
assumes that the part of the filename that follows the last period (if any) is an existing
extension that should be replaced. Consequently, "ShoppingList.12.25.2014" becomes
"ShoppingList.12.25.pdf".
To view the daily quotas for conversions, see
Quotas for Google
Services
. Newly created Google Workspace domains might be temporarily subject to stricter
quotas.
