AI-generated Key Takeaways
outlined_flag
The Calendar class offers methods to create all-day event series and modify calendar properties like color, description, visibility, name, and selection status.
All methods within the Calendar class for modifying calendar properties return the Calendar object itself.
Authorization using specific calendar scopes is required for scripts utilizing these Calendar and CalendarApp methods.
The CalendarApp class provides methods to subscribe users to calendars by ID, with options to set color, hidden, and selected properties during subscription.
Subscribing to a calendar via CalendarApp methods returns the newly subscribed Calendar object and requires the calendar ID to exist.
Calendar
App
Allows a script to read and update the user's Google Calendar. This class provides direct access
to the user's default calendar, as well as the ability to retrieve additional calendars that the
user owns or is subscribed to.
