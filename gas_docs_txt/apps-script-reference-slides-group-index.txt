A Group is a collection of PageElements joined as a single unit.
Groups can be aligned, duplicated, and have their children retrieved.
You can get and set properties of a Group such as height, width, left, top, rotation, title, and description.
Methods exist to change the layering of a Group (bring forward, bring to front, send backward, send to back).
Groups can be removed or ungrouped.

select()
Selects only the

selection. This is the same as calling
select(replace)
with
true
.
A script can only access the selection of the user who is running the script, and only if
the script is
bound
to the presentation.
This sets the parent
Page
of the

as the
current page selection

select(replace)
Selects the
Page
Element
in the active presentation.
A script can only access the selection of the user who is running the script, and only if
the script is
bound
to the presentation.
Pass
true
to this method to select only the
Page
Element
and remove any
previous selection. This also sets the parent
Page
of the
Page
Element
as the
current page selection
.
Pass
false
to select multiple
Page
Element
objects. The
Page
Element
objects must be in the same
Page
.
The following conditions must be met while selecting a page element using a
false
parameter:
The parent
Page
of the
Page
Element
object must be the
current page selection
.
There should not be multiple
Page
objects selected.
To make sure that’s the case the preferred approach is to select the parent
Page
first using
Page.selectAsCurrentPage()
and then select the page elements in that page.
const
slide
=
SlidesApp
.
getActivePresentation
().
getSlides
()[
0
];
// First select the slide page, as the current page selection.
slide
