Spreadsheet groups associate contiguous rows or columns that can be expanded or collapsed to hide or show content.
Each group has a control toggle to expand or collapse the group as a whole.
The depth of a group indicates its nested position within larger groups.
The collapsed state determines if a group remains collapsed or expanded after a parent group is expanded.
Groups can be manipulated using methods like collapse(), expand(), and remove().
Group
Access and modify spreadsheet groups. Groups are an association between an interval of contiguous
rows or columns that can be expanded or collapsed as a unit to hide/show the rows or columns.
Each group has a
control toggle
on the row or column directly before or after the group
(depending on settings) that can expand or collapse the group as a whole.
The
depth
of a group refers to the nested position of the group and how many larger
groups contain the group. The
collapsed state
of a group refers to whether the group
should remain collapsed or expanded after a parent group has been expanded. Additionally, at the
time that a group is collapsed or expanded, the rows or columns within the group are hidden or
set visible, though individual rows or columns can be hidden or set visible irrespective of the
collapsed state.
