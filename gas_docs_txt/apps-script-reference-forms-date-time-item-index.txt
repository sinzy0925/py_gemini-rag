DateTimeItem is a question item in Google Forms that allows respondents to indicate a date and time and can be graded when used in a quiz.
You can create or access DateTimeItem instances from a Form object.
Methods are available to manage DateTimeItem properties such as title, help text, required status, and point value.
The DateTimeItem also provides methods to create item responses, duplicate the item, and manage quiz-specific feedback.
