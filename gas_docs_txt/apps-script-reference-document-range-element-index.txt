RangeElement is a wrapper around an Element with possible start and end offsets, useful for representing partial selections within Text elements.
The getElement() method retrieves the Element corresponding to the RangeElement.
The getStartOffset() and getEndOffsetInclusive() methods provide the character positions for the start and end of a partial range, returning -1 for non-Text elements or full ranges.
The isPartial() method indicates whether the RangeElement covers the entire element or just a portion of its characters.
