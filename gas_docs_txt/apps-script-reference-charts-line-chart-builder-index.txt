LineChartBuilder is used to create line charts and offers various methods for customization.
Data for the line chart can be imported from external sources like Google Sheets using a data source URL.
You can set visual properties of the chart such as title, axis titles, dimensions, colors, curve style, and point style.
Methods are available to control the appearance of the legend and axis text, including text style and position.
Advanced options and logarithmic scale for the range axis can also be configured.
