A
JdbcTimestamp
is a JDBC Timestamp.
It provides methods to compare timestamps like
after()
and
before()
.
You can retrieve individual components of the timestamp such as date, hours, minutes, month, nanos, seconds, time, and year using the
get
methods.
The
set
methods allow you to modify different parts of the timestamp like date, hours, minutes, month, nanos, seconds, time, and year.
The documentation for the methods refers to the
java.sql.Timestamp
and
java.sql.Date
classes.

Description
date
Integer
The day of month to set. This timestamp is updated to represent a point in time
    within the specified day of month, with the year, month, hour, minute, and second the same
    as before, as interpreted in the local time zone. If the date was April 30, for example,
    and the date is set to 31, then it is treated as if it were on May 1, because April has
    only 30 days.
