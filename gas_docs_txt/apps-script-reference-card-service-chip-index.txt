A Chip is a UI element with an icon and text label that can be deactivated.
Chips are available for Google Chat apps and are in developer preview for Google Workspace add-ons.
Various methods are available to configure Chip behavior, such as setting alternative text, disabling the chip, setting an icon or label, and defining click actions.
Chip click actions can include opening a link, triggering an authorization flow, composing an email, or executing a custom action.
A UI object can only have one type of click action set among setOpenLink, setOnClickAction, setOnClickOpenLinkAction, setAuthorizationAction, or setComposeAction.
