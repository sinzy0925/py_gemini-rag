The Line object in Apps Script represents a line page element and provides methods to manipulate its properties and position.
You can align, move forward/backward, bring to front/back, duplicate, and remove a Line element.
Methods are available to get and set various properties of the line, including its start and end points, height, width, rotation, dash style, arrow styles, fill, weight, line category, and line type.
You can manage connections for the line, including getting and setting connection sites at the start and end, and rerouting connectors.
The Line object also supports setting and removing links, getting the page element type, parent group, parent page, and object ID.

A script can only access the selection of the user who is running the script, and only if
the script is
bound

Pass
true
to this method to select only the

.
Pass
false
to select multiple

The following conditions must be met while selecting a page element using a
false
parameter:
The parent
Page
of the

To make sure that’s the case the preferred approach is to select the parent
Page
first using
Page.selectAsCurrentPage()
and then select the page elements in that page.
