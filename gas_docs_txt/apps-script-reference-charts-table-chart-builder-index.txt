TableChartBuilder is a tool for building table charts.
Data for the table chart can be imported from an external source like a Google spreadsheet.
You can configure various aspects of the table chart including dimensions, paging, sorting, and data source.
The
build()
method is used to create the final Chart object from the builder.

Rtl
Table(rtlEnabled)
Adds basic support for right-to-left languages (such as Arabic or Hebrew) by reversing the
column order of the table, so that column zero is the right-most column, and the last column is
the left-most column.
This does not affect the column index in the underlying data, only the order of display.
Full bi-directional (BiDi) language display is not supported by the table visualization even
with this option. This option is ignored if you enable paging (using the page option), or if
the table has scroll bars because you have specified height and width options smaller than the
required table size. The default behavior is RTL support disabled.
