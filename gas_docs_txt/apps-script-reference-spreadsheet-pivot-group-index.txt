PivotGroup provides methods to access and modify pivot table breakout groups.
You can add or remove manual grouping rules and clear existing grouping rules or sorting.
Methods are available to get details about the group, such as its dimension, index, parent pivot table, and source data column.
You can control the display of labels and totals, and set date-time or histogram grouping rules.
Sorting can be set to ascending or descending, and you can sort by a specific pivot value.
