get
As(contentType)
Return the data inside this object as a blob converted to the specified content type. This
method adds the appropriate extension to the filename—for example, "myfile.pdf". However, it
assumes that the part of the filename that follows the last period (if any) is an existing
extension that should be replaced. Consequently, "ShoppingList.12.25.2014" becomes
"ShoppingList.12.25.pdf".
To view the daily quotas for conversions, see
Quotas for Google
Services
. Newly created Google Workspace domains might be temporarily subject to stricter
quotas.
Parameters
Name
Type
Description
content
Type
String

'text/markdown'
is also valid.
