The Ui object allows scripts to add UI elements like menus, dialogs, and sidebars to a Google App's user interface.
Scripts can only interact with the UI of the currently open editor if they are container-bound to that editor.
The Ui object provides methods to create alert boxes, input prompts, custom menus, modal and modeless dialogs, and sidebars.
Alert and prompt dialogs suspend the server-side script while open, while modal dialogs, modeless dialogs, and sidebars do not.
Buttons and ButtonSet are properties of the Ui object used to define and handle button responses in dialogs.
Ui
An instance of the user-interface environment for a Google App that allows the script to add
features like menus, dialogs, and sidebars. A script can only interact with the UI for the
current instance of an open editor, and only if the script is
container-bound
to the editor.

Creates a builder that can be used to insert a sub-menu into the editor's Extensions menu. The
menu isn't actually be updated until
Menu.addToUi()
is called. If the script is running
as an add-on, the sub-menu name matches the add-on's name in the web store; if the script is
bound
to the document directly, the sub-menu name
matches the script's name. For more information, see the
guide to menus

show
Modal
Dialog(userInterface, title)
Opens a modal dialog box in the user's editor with custom client-side content. This method does
not
suspend the server-side script while the dialog is open. To communicate with the
server-side script, the client-side component must make asynchronous callbacks using the
google.script
API for
Html
Service
. To close the dialog
programmatically, call
google.script.host.close()
on the client side of an
Html
Service
web
app. For more information, see the
guide to dialogs and
sidebars
.
Modal dialogs prevent the user from interacting with anything other than the dialog. By
contrast,
modeless dialogs
and
sidebars
let the user interact with the editor. In almost all cases, a
modal dialog or sidebar is a better choice than a modeless dialog.
// Display a modal dialog box with custom HtmlService content.

Parameters

    the
user
Interface
object.
Authorization
Scripts that use this method require authorization with one or more of the following
scopes
:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/script.container.ui
show
Modeless
Dialog(userInterface, title)
Opens a modeless dialog box in the user's editor with custom client-side content. This method
does
not
suspend the server-side script while the dialog is open. To communicate with
the server-side script, the client-side component must make asynchronous callbacks using the

programmatically, call

on the client side of an
Html

web
app. For more information, see the
guide to dialogs and

.
Modeless dialogs let the user interact with the editor behind the dialog. By contrast,
modal dialogs
do not. In almost all cases, a modal
dialog or
sidebar
is a better choice than a modeless dialog.
// Display a modeless dialog box with custom HtmlService content.

show
Sidebar(userInterface)
Opens a sidebar in the user's editor with custom client-side content. This method does
not
suspend the server-side script while the sidebar is open. To communicate with the
server-side script, the client-side component must make asynchronous callbacks using the
google.script
API for
Html
Service
. To close the sidebar
programmatically, call
google.script.host.close()
on the client side of an
Html
Service
web
app. For more information, see the
guide to dialogs and
sidebars
.
The sidebar displays on the right side of the editor for users whose environments use a
left-to-right language and on the left side of the editor for right-to-left languages. All
sidebars shown by scripts are 300 pixels wide.
// Display a sidebar with custom HtmlService content.
