The Session class provides access to session information like user language and script time zone.
You can get information about the active user, the user under whose authority the script is running, or a temporary user key that doesn't reveal identity.
The user's email address is not always available due to security policies, especially in contexts without explicit user authorization.
Methods for getting the time zone of the script and the current user information have deprecated versions.
Session
The Session class provides access to session information, such as the user's email address (in
some circumstances) and language setting.

get
Active
User()
Gets information about the current user. If security policies do not allow access to the user's
identity,
User.getEmail()
returns a blank string. The circumstances in which the
email address is available vary: for example, the user's email address is not available in any
context that allows a script to run without that user's authorization, like a simple

or

trigger, a custom function in Google Sheets, or a web app
deployed to "execute as me" (that is, authorized by the developer instead of the user).
However, these restrictions generally do not apply if the developer runs the script themselves
or belongs to the same Google Workspace domain as the user.

Effective
User()
Gets information about the user under whose authority the script is running. If the script is a
web app set to "execute as me" (the developer), this returns the developer's user account. If
the script is running under an
installable
trigger
, this returns the account of the user who created the trigger. In most other
scenarios, this returns the same account as
