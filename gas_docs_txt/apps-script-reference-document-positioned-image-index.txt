A PositionedImage is a fixed position image anchored to a Paragraph or ListItem, unlike an InlineImage which is an Element.
PositionedImages are not considered Elements and do not have parent or sibling Elements.
PositionedImages are placed using offsets from their anchor point and have an ID for referencing.
The provided example code demonstrates how to add a PositionedImage anchored to a new paragraph.
The documentation details various methods for getting and setting properties of a PositionedImage, such as its dimensions, layout, offsets, and associated blob data.

Image
Fixed position image anchored to a
Paragraph
. Unlike an
Inline
Image
, a
Positioned
Image
is
not an

, and is placed via offsets from
that anchor. A

Detailed documentation
get
As(contentType)
Return the data inside this object as a blob converted to the specified content type. This
method adds the appropriate extension to the filename—for example, "myfile.pdf". However, it
assumes that the part of the filename that follows the last period (if any) is an existing
extension that should be replaced. Consequently, "ShoppingList.12.25.2014" becomes
"ShoppingList.12.25.pdf".

Services

quotas.
