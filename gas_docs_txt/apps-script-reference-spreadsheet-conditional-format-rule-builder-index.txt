AI-generated Key Takeaways

The
ConditionalFormatRuleBuilder
class in Google Apps Script provides methods to set conditional formatting rules based on date, formula, number, and text conditions.
Date-based methods like
whenDateBefore
and
whenDateEqualTo
can use either specific dates or relative dates such as
RelativeDate.TODAY
.
whenFormulaSatisfied
allows applying formatting based on a custom formula that evaluates to true.
A comprehensive set of methods starting with
whenNumber
enables formatting based on numerical comparisons like equality, inequality, greater than/less than, and being within or outside a range.
Text-based conditions using methods like
whenTextContains
and
whenTextEqualTo
allow formatting based on whether cells contain, do not contain, start with, end with, or are exactly equal to a specific text string.
