outlined_flag
EmbeddedAreaChartBuilder is a builder specifically for area charts, providing methods to configure various aspects of the chart.
You can add or remove data ranges, set the chart's position, and build the final EmbeddedChart object using this builder.
The builder allows customization of chart appearance, including background color, line colors, legend position and style, point style, and axis titles and text styles.
You can change the chart type to other embedded chart types such as bar, column, line, pie, scatter, table, combo, or histogram charts using specific methods.
Advanced options can be set using the
setOption(option, value)
method, and you can also control hidden dimensions and data merging strategies.
