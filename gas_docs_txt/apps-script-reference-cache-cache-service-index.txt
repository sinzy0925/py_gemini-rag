CacheService provides access to caches for short-term data storage.
You can obtain specific cache instances for public (script-wide) or private (user-specific or document-specific) data.
Data stored in the cache is not guaranteed to persist until its expiration time, and reads might return
null
.
The CacheService offers methods to get caches scoped to the document, script, or current user.

Cache
Service allows you to access a cache for short term storage of data.
This class lets you get a specific cache instance. Public caches are for things that are not
dependent on which user is accessing your script. Private caches are for things which are
user-specific, like settings or recent activity.
The data you write to the cache is not guaranteed to persist until its expiration time. You
must be prepared to get back
null
from all reads.

is specific to the current document. If this method is called outside of the context of a
containing document (such as from a standalone script or web app), this method returns
null
.
