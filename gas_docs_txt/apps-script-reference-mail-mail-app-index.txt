MailApp service sends email with complete control over content and unlike GmailApp, it cannot access a user's Gmail inbox.
Scripts using MailApp are less likely to require re-authorization from a user compared to GmailApp scripts.
The
getRemainingDailyQuota()
method returns the number of recipients you can still send emails to for the day.
The
sendEmail()
method has several variations to send email messages with different parameters including recipients, subject, body, and optional arguments like attachments, CC, BCC, HTML body, inline images, sender name, no-reply option, and reply-to address.
Mail

request from a user than MailApp scripts.
