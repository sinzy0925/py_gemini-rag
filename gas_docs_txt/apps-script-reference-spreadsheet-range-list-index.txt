RangeList is a collection of one or more Range instances in the same sheet, useful for applying operations on collections of non-adjacent ranges or cells.
RangeList provides methods to modify the appearance and content of the ranges it contains, such as setting background color, font styles, borders, and number formats.
You can use a RangeList to manage checkboxes, including inserting, checking, unchecking, and removing them from the specified ranges.
RangeList methods allow for clearing various aspects of the ranges, such as content, format, data validations, and notes, with options for selective clearing.
Key methods like
activate()
,
breakApart()
, and
trimWhitespace()
provide functionalities for selecting ranges, unmerging cells, and cleaning up cell content within the RangeList.
