ImageButton is a CardService element for displaying an image button in Google Workspace add-ons and Google Chat apps.
Key methods allow setting alternative text, icon or icon URL, button style, and various actions upon clicking like opening a link, triggering an authorization flow, composing an email, or executing a custom action.
Multiple action types (setOpenLink, setOnClickAction, setOnClickOpenLinkAction, setAuthorizationAction, setComposeAction) are mutually exclusive on a single ImageButton.
The
setMaterialIcon
and
setImageButtonStyle
methods are available for Google Chat apps and in developer preview for Google Workspace add-ons.
The
setOverflowMenu
method allows displaying a pop-up menu with clickable items.
