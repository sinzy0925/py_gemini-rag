A Table is a PageElement representing a table on a page.
You can align, append, bring forward/to front, duplicate, get/set cell/column/row properties, and remove a Table using its methods.
The Table element provides methods for getting and setting its size, position, rotation, title, description, and transform.
You can insert columns and rows at specified indices within the table.

A script can only access the selection of the user who is running the script, and only if
the script is
bound
to the presentation.
Pass
true
to this method to select only the

.
Pass
false
to select multiple

Element
objects. The
Page
Element
objects must be in the same
Page

The following conditions must be met while selecting a page element using a
false
parameter:
The parent
Page
of the
Page
Element
object must be the
current page selection
.
There should not be multiple
Page
objects selected.
To make sure that’s the case the preferred approach is to select the parent
Page
first using
Page.selectAsCurrentPage()
and then select the page elements in that page.
const
