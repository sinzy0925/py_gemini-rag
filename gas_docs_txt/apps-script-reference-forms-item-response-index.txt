ItemResponse represents a response to a single question item within a form.
Item responses can be accessed from a FormResponse and created from an Item that asks for a response.
Methods are available to get and set feedback, the associated item, the respondent's answer, and the score for an item response.
The getResponse() method can return different types of data depending on the type of question item.
Setting feedback or score does not save the changes until Form.submitGrades() is called.
