Open
As
An enum that specifies how to open a URL.
The client can open a URL as either a full size window (if that is the frame used by the
client), or an overlay (such as a pop-up). The implementation depends on the client platform
capabilities, and the value selected may be ignored if the client does not support it.
FULL_SIZE
is supported by all clients.
Using
On
Close
may cause
Open
As
to be ignored; if the client platform cannot
support both selected values together,
On
Close
takes precedence.
To call an enum, you call its parent class, name, and property. For example,
CardService.OpenAs.FULL_SIZE
.
