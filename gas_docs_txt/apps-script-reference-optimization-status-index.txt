The status of a solution indicates whether a problem has been solved and if the solution is optimal.
Status is represented by an enum which can be accessed by calling the parent class, name, and property.
Different status values like
OPTIMAL
,
FEASIBLE
,
INFEASIBLE
,
UNBOUNDED
,
ABNORMAL
,
MODEL_INVALID
, and
NOT_SOLVED
describe the outcome of the solution process.
Status
Status of the solution. Before solving a problem the status will be
NOT_SOLVED
;
afterwards it will take any of the other values depending if it successfully found a solution and
if the solution is optimal.
To call an enum, you call its parent class, name, and property. For example,
LinearOptimizationService.Status.OPTIMAL
.

Description
OPTIMAL
Enum
Status when an optimal solution has been found.

Enum
Status when the current model is unfeasible (has no solution).
UNBOUNDED
Enum
Status when the current model is unbound.
ABNORMAL
Enum
Status when it failed to find a solution for unexpected reasons.
MODEL_INVALID
