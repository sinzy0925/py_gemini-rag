Detailed documentation
get
Document
Lock()
Gets a lock that prevents any user of the current document from concurrently running a section
of code. A code section guarded by a document lock can be executed simultaneously by script
instances running in the context of different documents, but by no more than one execution for
any given document. Note that the lock is not actually acquired until
Lock.tryLock(timeoutInMillis)
or
Lock.waitLock(timeoutInMillis)
is called. If this method is called outside of the context of a
containing document (such as from a standalone script or webapp),
null
is returned.
Return
Lock
— a lock scoped to the script and current document, or
null
if called from a
    standalone script or webapp
get
Script
Lock()
Gets a lock that prevents any user from concurrently running a section of code. A code section
guarded by a script lock cannot be executed simultaneously regardless of the identity of the
user. Note that the lock is not actually acquired until
Lock.tryLock(timeoutInMillis)
or
Lock.waitLock(timeoutInMillis)
is called.
Return
Lock
— a lock scoped to the script
get
User
Lock()
Gets a lock that prevents the current user from concurrently running a section of code. A code
section guarded by a user lock can be executed simultaneously by different users, but by no
more than one execution for any given user. The lock is "private" to the user. Note that the
lock is not actually acquired until
Lock.tryLock(timeoutInMillis)
or
Lock.waitLock(timeoutInMillis)
is
called.
Return
Lock
— a lock scoped to the script and current user
