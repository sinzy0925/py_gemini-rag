AI-generated Key Takeaways
outlined_flag
LinearOptimizationEngine is used to model and solve linear programs by defining variables, constraints, and objectives.
You can add variables with specified bounds and types using methods like
addVariable
and
addVariables
.
Constraints with defined bounds can be added using
addConstraint
or
addConstraints
, and variable coefficients within these constraints are set separately.
The objective function is defined by setting the coefficient for each variable using
setObjectiveCoefficient
.
The optimization direction can be set to maximization or minimization using
setMaximization
or
setMinimization
.
The
solve()
method is used to find the solution to the defined linear program.

Engine
The engine used to model and solve a linear program. The example below solves the following
linear program:
Two variables,
x
and
y
:
0 ≤ x ≤ 10
0 ≤ y ≤ 5
Constraints:
0 ≤ 2 * x + 5 * y ≤ 10
0 ≤ 10 * x + 3 * y ≤ 20
Objective:
Maximize
x + y
