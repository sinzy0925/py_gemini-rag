A NamedRange is a Range with a name and ID for later retrieval; names are not unique, but IDs are unique within the tab.
Once added to a tab, a NamedRange cannot be modified, only removed.
NamedRanges can be accessed by any script accessing the tab, and prefixing names with a unique string can help avoid conflicts.
The available methods for a NamedRange are getId(), getName(), getRange(), and remove().

Range
A
Range
that has a name and ID to allow later retrieval. Names are not
necessarily unique; several different ranges in the same tab may share the same name, much like a
class in HTML. By contrast, IDs are unique within the tab, like an ID in HTML. Once a
Named
Range
has been added to a tab, it cannot be modified, only removed.
A
