PageNavigationType is an enum representing supported types of page navigation in forms.
Page navigation occurs after completing a page with a chosen option containing a navigation instruction, with only the last instruction taking effect if multiple are chosen on the same page.
Choices using page navigation cannot be combined in the same item with choices that do not.
Page navigation has no effect on the last page of a form.
You call an enum like
FormApp.PageNavigationType.CONTINUE
to use it.

Type
An enum representing the supported types of page navigation. Page navigation types can be
accessed from
Form
App.PageNavigationType
.
The page navigation occurs after the respondent completes a page that contains the option, and
only if the respondent chose that option. If the respondent chose multiple options with
page-navigation instructions on the same page, only the last navigation option has any effect.
Page navigation also has no effect on the last page of a form.
Choices that use page navigation cannot be combined in the same item with choices that do not
use page navigation.
To call an enum, you call its parent class, name, and property. For example,
FormApp.PageNavigationType.CONTINUE
.
// Create a form and add a new multiple-choice item and a page-break item.
const
form
=
FormApp
.
create
(
'Form Name'
);
const
item
=
form
.
addMultipleChoiceItem
();
const
pageBreak
=
form
.
addPageBreakItem
();
// Set some choices with go-to-page logic.
const
rightChoice
=
item
.
createChoice
(
'Vanilla'
,
FormApp
.
PageNavigationType
.
SUBMIT
,
);
const
wrongChoice
=
item
.
createChoice
(
'Chocolate'
,
FormApp
.
PageNavigationType
.
RESTART
,
);
// For GO_TO_PAGE, just pass in the page break item. For CONTINUE (normally the
// default), pass in CONTINUE explicitly because page navigation cannot be mixed
// with non-navigation choices.
const
iffyChoice
=
item
.
createChoice
(
'Peanut'

pageBreak

const
otherChoice
=
item
