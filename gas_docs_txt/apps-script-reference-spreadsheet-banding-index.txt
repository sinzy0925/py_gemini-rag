Banding refers to the color patterns applied to rows or columns of a range within a spreadsheet.
Each banding is defined by a range and specific colors for its rows, columns, headers, and footers.
You can access and modify various color properties of a banding for the first and second alternating rows/columns, as well as header and footer rows/columns.
Banding provides methods to copy, remove, and set the range for the banding.
Some methods for getting color properties by returning a String color code are deprecated and replaced by methods that return a Color object.
Banding
Access and modify bandings, the color patterns applied to rows or columns of a range. Each
banding consists of a range and a set of colors for rows, columns, headers, and footers.
