AI-generated Key Takeaways
outlined_flag
The linear optimization service is used to model and solve linear and mixed-integer linear programs.
Key classes for this service include
LinearOptimizationConstraint
,
LinearOptimizationEngine
,
LinearOptimizationService
, and
LinearOptimizationSolution
.
The
LinearOptimizationEngine
is used to build the linear program model by adding constraints and variables, and setting the optimization direction.
The
LinearOptimizationSolution
provides methods to retrieve the objective value, the status of the solution, and the values of the variables.
The
Status
property indicates the result of the solve operation, such as
OPTIMAL
,
FEASIBLE
, or
INFEASIBLE
.
Optimization
The linear optimization service, used to model and solve linear and mixed-integer linear
programs.
