The
CalendarEvent
class in Google Apps Script is used to manage properties, guests, and reminders of a single calendar event.
Key functionalities include managing reminders (adding, removing, retrieving), managing guests (adding, removing, getting lists, setting permissions), getting various event information (dates, times, titles, locations, etc.), modifying event properties using setter methods, deleting events, and managing custom tags.
Most methods require authorization with either read-write (
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar
) or read-only (
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly
) scopes.
Calendar

necessarily preserve the original day-of-year unmodified.
