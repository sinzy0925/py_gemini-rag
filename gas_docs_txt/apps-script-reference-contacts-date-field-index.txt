DateField is a deprecated class used only by the Contacts service to represent a date field in a Contact.
Instead of DateField, the People API advanced service should be used.
Dates in App Script outside the Contacts service use JavaScript's standard Date object.
The DateField class has methods to get and set its label.
Most methods of the DateField class are deprecated, including those for getting and setting the day, month, and year, and for deleting the date field.
