ListStyle represents the list styling for a range of text.
Methods are available to apply a list preset, get the glyph, retrieve the list the text belongs to, get the nesting level, check if the text is in a list, and remove the text from a list.
Applying a list preset applies the style to overlapping paragraphs, removing leading tabs and potentially adding the paragraphs to a preceding list if applicable.
Authorization with specific scopes is required for scripts using these ListStyle methods.

Detailed documentation
apply
List
Preset(listPreset)
Applies the specified
List
Preset
to all of the paragraphs that overlap with the text.
The nesting level of each paragraph is determined by counting leading tabs in front of each
paragraph. To avoid excess space between the glyphs and the corresponding paragraph, these
leading tabs are removed by this method.
If the paragraph immediately before paragraphs being updated is in a
List
with a
matching list preset and the paragraphs being updated are not already in a different list, the
paragraphs being updated are added to that preceding list.
