The Logger class is used to write to the Execution log and Google Cloud Logging, especially for structured logging and JSON payloads.
Use the clear() method to clear the log and getLog() to retrieve all messages in the current log.
The log() method can write various data types to the log, including strings, JavaScript objects, or objects with a message property.
The log() method also supports writing formatted strings to the log using placeholders and values.

log(data)
Writes the data to the log. The data can be a string, a JavaScript object, or an object with a
message
property.
Logger
.
log
(
"my log message"
);
// Info   my logmessage
Logger
.
log
({
key
:
"value"
});
// Info   {key=value}
Logger
.
log
({
message
:
"my log message"
,
data
:
{
key
:
"value"
}
})
// Info   my logmessage
When passing an object, if the object contains a
message
property, that property is
used as the log message. Otherwise, the
to
String()
method is called to convert the
object to a string. All other properties which are JSON serializable are included as part of
the
json
Payload
in the
Log
Entry
, similar to the example below:
{
"insertId"
:
"w5eib..."
,
"jsonPayload"
