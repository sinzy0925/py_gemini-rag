MatchType is an enumeration used to define how a string value should be matched.
Matching a string using MatchType is a boolean operation returning
true
based on EXACT, PREFIX, or ANY match types.
MatchType can be used by a string filter control to filter data table rows based on a specified column and filter value.

Type
An enumeration of how a string value should be matched. Matching a string is a boolean operation.
Given a string, a match term (string), and a match type, the operation outputs
true
in
the following cases:
If the match type equals EXACT and the match term equals the string.
If the match type equals PREFIX and the match term is a prefix of the string.
If the match type equals ANY and the match term is a substring of the string.
This enumeration can be used in by a string filter control to decide which rows to filter out
of the data table. Given a column to filter on, leave only the rows that match the value entered
in the filter input box, using one of the above matching types.
To call an enum, you call its parent class, name, and property. For example,
Charts.MatchType.EXACT
.
