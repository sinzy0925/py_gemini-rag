Google Drive folders can be managed using the
DriveApp
service and the
Folder
class in Apps Script.
The
Folder
class provides methods for managing permissions, creating files and folders, retrieving information, and manipulating folder properties.
Several methods for adding and removing files and folders have been deprecated in favor of using
moveTo
or
createShortcut
.
Many modification methods return the
Folder
object for chaining, and require the
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
scope, while read-only operations typically need
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly
.
Folder
A folder in Google Drive. Folders can be accessed or created from
Drive
App
.
// Log the name of every folder in the user's Drive.

folders
=
DriveApp
