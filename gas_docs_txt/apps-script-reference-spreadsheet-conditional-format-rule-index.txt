include
copy()
,
getBooleanCondition()
,
getGradientCondition()
, and
getRanges()
.
copy()
returns a builder preset with the current rule's settings.
getBooleanCondition()
and
getGradientCondition()
retrieve condition details if applicable, otherwise return
null
.
getRanges()
returns the ranges where the conditional format rule is applied.
