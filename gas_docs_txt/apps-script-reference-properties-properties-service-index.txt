PropertiesService allows scripts to store simple data in key-value pairs with different scopes.
Properties can be scoped to one script, one user of a script, or one document in which an add-on is used, but cannot be shared between scripts.
There are three types of property stores: document properties (accessible by all users within a document/spreadsheet/form), script properties (accessible by all users within a script), and user properties (accessible only by the current user within a script).
The methods
getDocumentProperties()
,
getScriptProperties()
, and
getUserProperties()
are used to access these different property stores.
Document properties are only available for scripts published as add-ons or bound to a Google file type.
