Item is a generic form item with common properties like title and help text, accessible or created from a Form.
To work with type-specific properties, check the item's type using
getType()
and cast it to the appropriate class using methods like
asCheckboxItem()
.
The documentation provides a list of methods to cast a generic Item to various specific item types, such as
asCheckboxGridItem()
,
asDateItem()
, and
asTextItem()
.
Methods like
duplicate()
,
getHelpText()
,
getId()
,
getIndex()
,
getTitle()
,
getType()
,
setHelpText()
, and
setTitle()
are available for operating on the Item object.
Scripts using these methods often require specific authorization scopes related to Google Forms.
