A
LinearOptimizationConstraint
object represents a linear constraint of the form
lowerBound ≤ Sum(a(i) x(i)) ≤ upperBound
.
The
setCoefficient
method is used to set the coefficient of a variable within a constraint.
By default, variables in a constraint have a coefficient of 0.
The provided example demonstrates how to create a variable and a constraint and then set the coefficient of the variable within that constraint.

Optimization
Constraint
Object storing a linear constraint of the form
lower
Bound ≤ Sum(a(i) x(i)) ≤ upperBound
where
lower
Bound
and
upper
Bound
are constants,
a(i)
are constant
coefficients and
x(i)
are variables (unknowns).
The example below creates one variable
x
with values between
0
and
5
and creates the constraint
0 ≤ 2 * x ≤ 5
. This is done by first creating a constraint
with the lower bound
5
and upper bound
5
. Then the coefficient for variable
x
in this constraint is set to
2
.
const
engine
=
LinearOptimizationService
.
createEngine
();
// Create a variable so we can add it to the constraint
engine
.
addVariable
(
'x'
,
0
,
5
);
// Create a linear constraint with the bounds 0 and 10
const
constraint
=
engine
.
addConstraint
(
0
,
10
);
// Set the coefficient of the variable in the constraint. The constraint is now:
// 0 <= 2 * x <= 5
constraint
.
setCoefficient

Coefficient(variableName, coefficient)
Sets the coefficient of a variable in the constraint. By default, variables have a coefficient
of 0.
