AI-generated Key Takeaways

A FormResponse object represents a response to a Google Form and can be used to access, submit, or generate pre-filled URLs for responses.
You can retrieve all item responses for a form response using
getItemResponses()
, or specifically retrieve gradable item responses using
getGradableItemResponses()
.
Individual item responses can be retrieved using
getResponseForItem(item)
or
getGradableResponseForItem(item)
.
Methods like
getEditResponseUrl()
and
toPrefilledUrl()
allow for generating URLs to edit submitted responses or create pre-filled forms based on existing responses.
Form responses can be programmatically submitted using the
submit()
method and updated with item grades using
withItemGrade(gradedResponse)
.
Form
Response
A response to the form as a whole. A
Form
Response
can be used in three ways: to access
the answers submitted by a respondent (see
get
Item
Responses()
), to programmatically
submit a response to the form (see
with
Item
Response(response)
and
submit()
), and to generate a URL for the form which pre-fills fields using the provided
answers.
Form
Response
s can be created or accessed from a

Detailed documentation
get
Edit
Response
Url()
Generates a URL that can be used to edit a response that has already been submitted. If the
Form.setAllowResponseEdits(enabled)
setting is disabled, the link leads to a page that
explains that editing form responses is disabled. Anyone who visits the link can edit the
response, although they need an account with access to the form if the
Form.setRequireLogin(requireLogin)
setting is enabled. If the
Form.setCollectEmail(collect)
setting is enabled, the form records the email address of the user who edited the response
instead of the email address of the original respondent.
For a form response that the script has created but not yet submitted, this method returns
null
.
// Opens the Forms file by its ID.
// If you created your script from within a Google Forms file, you can
// use FormApp.getActiveForm() instead.
// TODO(developer): Replace the ID with your own.

Item
Responses()
Gets all item responses contained in a form response, in the same order that the items appear

a missing answer, it still returns an
Item
Response
if the corresponding
Item
can be graded (that is, has a point value), even if there isn't an actual response. However, if
the
Item
isn't gradable, this method excludes that item from its returned array.

multiple times for the same item, only the last grade is retained. If the ItemResponse contains
no grades, this method removes grades for the item.
