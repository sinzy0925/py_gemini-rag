A RatingItem is a question type in Google Forms that allows respondents to provide a rating, and can be graded when used in a quiz.
You can access or create RatingItems from a Form object using Google Apps Script.
RatingItems have methods to get and set properties like the rating scale level, rating icon, title, and whether the question is required.
Methods are available to duplicate a RatingItem or create a response for it.
Authorization scopes like
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms
are required to use these methods.
