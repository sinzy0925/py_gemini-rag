ParagraphTextItem is a question item in Google Forms that allows respondents to enter a block of text.
ParagraphTextItems can be accessed or created from a Form object.
When used in a quiz, ParagraphTextItems are graded.
You can clear validation, create responses, duplicate, get/set feedback, help text, ID, index, points, title, type, required status, and validation for a ParagraphTextItem using its methods.
