WordArt is a PageElement that represents word art and provides methods to manipulate its properties and behavior.
WordArt elements can be aligned on the page, moved forward or backward in layering, duplicated, and removed.
You can retrieve various properties of a WordArt element, such as its connection sites, alt text description and title, dimensions, position, link, object ID, page element type, parent group or page, rendered text, rotation, and transform.
You can modify properties of a WordArt element, including its alt text description and title, dimensions (height and width), position (left and top), link, rotation, and transform.
WordArt elements can be selected in the active presentation, replacing previous selections or being added to the current selection.

Pass
true
to this method to select only the

Element
objects must be in the same
Page
.
The following conditions must be met while selecting a page element using a
false
parameter:
The parent
Page
of the
Page
Element
object must be the
current page selection
.
There should not be multiple
Page
objects selected.
To make sure that’s the case the preferred approach is to select the parent
Page
first using
Page.selectAsCurrentPage()
and then select the page elements in that page.
