RecurrenceRule represents a recurrence rule for an event series and can be chained with other rule creation methods.
Modifiers like
times()
and
interval()
apply to the most recently added rule.
Recurrence rules can be added on a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly basis, with options for both inclusion and exclusion.
You can configure rules to apply only at specific intervals or on specific days, weeks, or months using various
onlyOn
and
onlyIn
methods.
Recurrence rules can be configured to end after a certain number of occurrences using
times()
or on a specific date using
until()
.
Recurrence
Rule
Represents a recurrence rule for an event series.
Note that this class also behaves like the
Event
Recurrence
that it belongs to,
allowing you to chain rule creation together like so:
const
recurrence
=
CalendarApp
.
newRecurrence
().
addDailyRule
().
times
(
3
).
interval
(
2
).
addWeeklyExclusion
().
times
(

);
Modifiers like
times(times)
and
interval(interval)
are applied to the most recently added rule.
