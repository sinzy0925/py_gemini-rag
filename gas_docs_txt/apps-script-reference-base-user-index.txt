Detailed documentation
get
Email()
Gets the user's email address, if available. If security policies do not allow access to the
user's email address, this method returns a blank string. The circumstances in which the email
address is available vary: for example, the user's email address is not available in any
context that allows a script to run without that user's authorization, like a simple
on
Open(e)
or
on
Edit(e)
trigger, a custom function in Google Sheets, or a web app
deployed to "execute as me" (that is, authorized by the developer instead of the user).
However, these restrictions generally do not apply if the developer runs the script themselves
or belongs to the same Google Workspace domain as the user.
