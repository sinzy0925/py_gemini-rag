ClockTriggerBuilder is used to create clock triggers.
You can specify when the trigger runs using methods like
after()
,
at()
,
atDate()
,
atHour()
,
everyDays()
,
everyHours()
,
everyMinutes()
,
everyWeeks()
,
onMonthDay()
, and
onWeekDay()
.
You can refine the trigger's execution time with
nearMinute()
and
inTimezone()
.
The
create()
method is used to finalize and schedule the trigger.
