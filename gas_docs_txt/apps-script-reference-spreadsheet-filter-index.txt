The Filter class is used to modify existing filters on Grid sheets.
To use the Filter class, you must first access the filter using Range.getFilter() or Sheet.getFilter().
Common uses of the Filter class include removing a filter and getting the range the filter applies to.
The Filter class provides methods for managing filter criteria on columns and sorting the filtered range.
Filter
Use this class to modify existing filters on
Grid
sheets, the default type of
sheet. Grid sheets are regular sheets with data that aren't connected to a database.
If a filter doesn’t exist on the sheet yet, create one using
Range.createFilter()
.
To use this class, you must first access the grid sheet filter using
Range.getFilter()
or
Sheet.getFilter()
.
Common uses
Remove a filter
The below sample gets the filter on the active sheet and removes it.
const
ss
=
SpreadsheetApp
.
getActiveSheet
();
const
filter
=
ss
.
getFilter
();
// Removes the filter from the active sheet.
filter
.
remove
();
Get the range that the filter applies to
The below sample gets the filter on the active sheet, then uses the
get
Range()
method from
this class to log the range that the filter applies to.
const
ss
=
SpreadsheetApp
.
getActiveSheet
();
// Gets the existing filter on the active sheet.
const
filter
=
ss
.
getFilter
();
// Logs the range that the filter applies to in A1 notation.
console
.
log
(
filter
.
getRange
().
getA1Notation
());

set
Column
Filter
Criteria(columnPosition, filterCriteria)
Sets the filter criteria on the specified column. First, create the filter criteria builder
using
Spreadsheet
App.newFilterCriteria()
. Then add criteria to the builder
using the
Filter
Criteria

class. After you've built your criteria, set it as the
filter
Criteria
parameter for this method.
