A layout in presentation slides acts as a template defining the arrangement and styling of content.
Layouts provide methods to access and manipulate various page elements like background, images, shapes, and placeholders.
You can insert diverse elements into a layout, including groups, images, lines, shapes, Sheets charts, tables, text boxes, videos, and Word Art.
Layouts also support operations such as removing themselves, replacing all text within them, and selecting themselves as the current page.
All methods related to layouts require specific Google Sheets authorization scopes.
Layout
A layout in a presentation.
Each layout serves as a template for slides that inherit from it, determining how content on
those slides is arranged and styled.
