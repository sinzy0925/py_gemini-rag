Documents can contain one or more tabs, each with rich text and elements like tables and lists.
Documents can be opened or created using
DocumentApp
.
Methods that modify text contents operate on the active or first tab; scripts can be migrated to support tabs using
getTabs()
and
Tab.asDocumentTab()
.
The
Document
class provides methods for managing document content, permissions, and properties, such as adding elements like bookmarks, footers, and headers, managing editors and viewers, and retrieving document information like ID, language, name, and URL.
Document
A document, containing one or more
Tab
objects, each of which contains rich text and
elements such as tables and lists.
Documents may be opened or created using
Document
App
.
// Open a document by ID.
let
doc
=
DocumentApp
.
openById
(
'<my-id>'
);
// Create and open a document.
doc
=
DocumentApp
.
create
(
'Document Title'
);
Methods on the
Document
class that directly access and modify text contents operate on
either the active tab (in scripts
bound
to a
particular document) or the first tab (if an active one isn't available). Scripts relying on
these methods (for example,
get
Body()
) can be migrated to support tabs using
get
Tabs()
and then
Tab.asDocumentTab()
.
