A TextItem in Google Forms allows respondents to enter a single line of text and can be graded when used in a quiz.
You can access or create a TextItem from a Form using Apps Script, as demonstrated in the provided code example.
TextItems offer various methods to manage their properties, such as setting the title, help text, required status, and points, as well as managing data validation and duplicating the item.
Methods are available to retrieve information about a TextItem, including its ID, index, title, type, points, help text, and whether it is required.
Authorization with specific scopes (
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms.currentonly
or
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/forms
) is required for scripts using these TextItem methods.
