The Image object represents an image as a PageElement in Google Slides.
You can manipulate the position and layer of an image using methods like
alignOnPage
,
bringForward
,
bringToFront
,
sendBackward
, and
sendToBack
.
The image data can be accessed as a Blob using
getAs()
and
getBlob()
.
You can retrieve information about the image such as its border, connection sites, content URL, description, dimensions, position, link, object ID, parent elements, rotation, source URL, title, and transform using various
get
methods.
Images can be duplicated, removed, and replaced using
duplicate
,
remove
, and
replace
methods respectively.
You can scale the height and width of an image using
scaleHeight
and
scaleWidth
.
Images can be selected programmatically using the
select
method.
You can set properties like the description, height, left position, link to a slide or URL, rotation, title, top position, and transform using the corresponding
set
methods.

As(contentType)
Return the data inside this object as a blob converted to the specified content type. This
method adds the appropriate extension to the filename—for example, "myfile.pdf". However, it

extension that should be replaced. Consequently, "ShoppingList.12.25.2014" becomes
"ShoppingList.12.25.pdf".

in the active presentation.
A script can only access the selection of the user who is running the script, and only if
the script is
bound
to the presentation.
Pass
true
to this method to select only the
Page
Element
and remove any
previous selection. This also sets the parent
Page
of the
Page
Element
as the
current page selection
.
Pass
false
to select multiple
Page
Element
objects. The
Page
Element
objects must be in the same
Page
.
The following conditions must be met while selecting a page element using a
false
parameter:
The parent
Page
of the
Page
Element
object must be the
current page selection
.
There should not be multiple
Page
objects selected.
To make sure that’s the case the preferred approach is to select the parent
Page
first using
Page.selectAsCurrentPage()
and then select the page elements in that page.
