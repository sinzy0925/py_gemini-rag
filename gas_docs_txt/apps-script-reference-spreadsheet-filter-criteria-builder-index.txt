FilterCriteriaBuilder is used to create filter criteria for spreadsheets.
To create filter criteria, you must use SpreadsheetApp.newFilterCriteria(), add settings using the builder's methods, and then use build() to assemble the criteria.
Common uses include hiding values and showing only non-empty cells.
The builder offers methods for setting criteria based on values, colors, dates, numbers, text, formulas, and boolean conditions.
Filter
Criteria
Builder
Builder for filter criteria. To add criteria to a filter, you must do the following:
Create the criteria builder using
Spreadsheet
App.newFilterCriteria()
.
Add settings to the builder using the methods from this class.
Use
build()
to assemble the criteria with your specified settings.
Common uses
Hide values on a sheet
The following sample gets a sheet's existing filter and adds criteria that hides the cells in
column C that contain "hello" or "world." The criteria in this sample can only be used with
filters on
Grid
sheets, the default type of sheet.
const
ss
=
SpreadsheetApp
.
getActiveSheet
();
const
filter
=
ss
.
getFilter

const
criteria
=
SpreadsheetApp
.

.
setHiddenValues
([
'hello'
,
'world'
])
.
build
();
filter
.
setColumnFilterCriteria
(
3
,
criteria
);
Only show non-empty cells
The following sample adds a filter to a
Data
Source
sheet, a sheet that's
connected to a database, with criteria that only shows cells in the "Category" column that aren't
empty.
// Gets the sheet named "Connected sheet," which is connected to a database.
const
sheet
=
SpreadsheetApp
.
getActiveSpreadsheet

.
getSheetByName

'Connected sheet'
)

ss
.

// Assembles the criteria.
filter
.
setColumnFilterCriteria
(
2
,
criteria
);
Return
Filter
Criteria
— A representation of the filter criteria.
copy()
Copies this filter criteria and creates a criteria builder that you can apply to another
filter.
You can use this method with any type of filter. If you're using a sheet filter, you can
copy the criteria to another column.
const
ss
=
SpreadsheetApp
.
getActiveSheet
();
const
filter
=

// Makes a copy of the filter criteria applied to column C.
const

().
build
();
// Applies the copied criteria to column B. The copied criteria overwrites any
// existing criteria on column B.
filter
.
setColumnFilterCriteria
(
2
,
criteria
);
Return
Filter
Criteria
Builder
— A filter criteria builder based on this filter criteria.
get
Criteria
Type()
Returns the criteria's boolean type, for example,
CELL_EMPTY
. To learn about the types
of boolean criteria, see the
Boolean
Criteria
enum.
People often use this method to add boolean condition criteria to a filter without replacing
existing criteria.
To get the arguments for the criteria, use
get
Criteria
Values()
.
To use the criteria type and criteria values to create or modify filter criteria, see
with
Criteria(criteria, args)
.
You can use this method for any type of filter. If the filter criteria isn't a boolean
condition, returns
null
.
const
ss
=
SpreadsheetApp
.
getActiveSheet
();
// Gets the filter on the active sheet.
const
filter
=

// object.

.
getColumnFilterCriteria
(
2
).
getCriteriaType

// Logs the criteria type.
console

);
Return
Boolean
Criteria
— The type of boolean criteria, or
null
if the criteria isn't a boolean
    condition.
get
Criteria
Values()
Returns an array of arguments for boolean criteria. Some boolean criteria types don't have
arguments and return an empty array, for example,
CELL_NOT_EMPTY
.
People often use this method to add boolean condition criteria to a filter without replacing
existing criteria.
To get the boolean criteria type, use
get
Criteria
Type()
.
To use the criteria type and criteria values to create or modify a filter criteria, see
with
Criteria(criteria, args)
.
You can use this method for any type of filter.
const
ss

    and their type match the corresponding
when...()
method of the
Filter
Criteria
Builder
class.
