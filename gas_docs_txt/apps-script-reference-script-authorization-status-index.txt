Description
REQUIRED
Enum
The user needs to authorize this script to use one or more services. In most cases, the script
prompts the user for authorization the next time it runs; however, if the script is published
as an
add-on
that uses
installable triggers
, the trigger runs the
script without prompting for authorization but throws an exception if the script attempts to
call the unauthorized service.
NOT_REQUIRED
Enum
The user has granted this script all the authorization it currently requires.
