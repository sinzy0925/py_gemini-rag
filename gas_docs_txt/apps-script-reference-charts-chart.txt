Detailed documentation
get
As(contentType)
Return the data inside this object as a blob converted to the specified content type. This
method adds the appropriate extension to the filename—for example, "myfile.pdf". However, it
assumes that the part of the filename that follows the last period (if any) is an existing
extension that should be replaced. Consequently, "ShoppingList.12.25.2014" becomes
"ShoppingList.12.25.pdf".
