A Lock is a mutual-exclusion lock used to ensure that only one instance of a script executes a given section of code at a time, particularly useful for callbacks and triggers to prevent collisions with shared resources.
The
Lock
class provides methods such as
hasLock()
,
releaseLock()
,
tryLock(timeoutInMillis)
, and
waitLock(timeoutInMillis)
to manage the lock's acquisition and release.
Using a lock, like in the provided example of generating unique ticket numbers, prevents issues where multiple users accessing shared properties simultaneously could lead to incorrect or duplicate data.
Lock
A representation of a mutual-exclusion lock.
This class lets scripts make sure that only one instance of the script executes a given
section of code at a time. This is particularly useful for callbacks and triggers, where a user
action might cause changes to a shared resource and you want to ensure that there aren't
collisions.
The following example shows how to use a lock in a form submit handler.
// Generates a unique ticket number for every form submission.
function
onFormSubmit
(
e
)
{
const
targetCell
=
e
.
range
.
offset
(
0
,
e
.
range
.
getNumColumns
(),
1
,
1
);
// Gets a script lock before modifying a shared resource.
const
lock
=
LockService
.
getScriptLock
();
// Waits for up to 30 seconds for other processes to finish.
lock
.
waitLock
(
30000
);
const
scriptProperties
=
PropertiesService
.
getScriptProperties
();
const
ticketNumber
=
Number
(
scriptProperties
.
getProperty
(
'lastTicketNumber'
))
+
1
;
scriptProperties
.
setProperty
(
'lastTicketNumber'
,
ticketNumber
);
// Releases the lock so that other processes can continue.
lock
.
releaseLock
();
targetCell
.
setValue
(
ticketNumber
);
}
Without the Lock service, if two users submit the form at approximately the same time, the ticket
numbers could end up the same, since the
last
Ticket
Number
property could change after it
was read from the
Script
Properties
but before the new value was written back.
Methods
Method
Return type
Brief description
has
Lock()
Boolean
Returns true if the lock was acquired.
release
Lock()
void
Releases the lock, allowing other processes waiting on the lock to continue.
try
Lock(timeoutInMillis)
Boolean
Attempts to acquire the lock, timing out after the provided number of milliseconds.
wait
Lock(timeoutInMillis)
void
Attempts to acquire the lock, timing out with an exception after the provided number of
milliseconds.
Detailed documentation
has
Lock()
Returns true if the lock was acquired. This method will return false if
try
Lock(timeoutInMillis)
or
wait
Lock(timeoutInMillis)
were never called, timed out before the lock could be retrieved, or if
release
Lock()
was called.
const
lock
=
LockService
.
getScriptLock
();
lock
.
tryLock
(
10000
);
if
(
!
lock
.
hasLock
())
{
Logger
.
log
(
'Could not obtain lock after 10 seconds.'
);
}
Return
Boolean
— true if the lock was acquired, false otherwise
release
Lock()
Releases the lock, allowing other processes waiting on the lock to continue. The lock is
automatically released when the script terminates, but for efficiency it is best to release it
as soon as you no longer need exclusive access to a section of code. This method has no effect
if the lock has not been acquired.
Note that if you are working with a spreadsheet, you should call SpreadsheetApp.flush()
prior to releasing the lock, to commit all pending changes to the spreadsheet while you still
have exclusive access to it.
const
lock
=
LockService
.
getScriptLock
();
lock
.
waitLock
(
10000
);
// Do some work on a shared resource.
lock
.
releaseLock
();
try
Lock(timeoutInMillis)
Attempts to acquire the lock, timing out after the provided number of milliseconds. This method
has no effect if the lock has already been acquired.
const
lock
=
LockService
.
getScriptLock
();
const
success
=
lock
.
tryLock
(
10000
);
if
(
!
success
)
{
Logger
.
log
(
'Could not obtain lock after 10 seconds.'
);

Parameters

Description
timeout

Integer
how long to wait to acquire the lock, in milliseconds
Return
Boolean
— true if the lock was acquired, false otherwise
wait
Lock(timeoutInMillis)
Attempts to acquire the lock, timing out with an exception after the provided number of
milliseconds. This method is the same as
try
Lock(timeoutInMillis)
except that it throws an exception
when the lock could not be acquired instead of returning false.
const
lock

LockService
