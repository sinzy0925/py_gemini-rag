FileIterator allows scripts to iterate over potentially large collections of files.
File iterators can be accessed from DriveApp or a Folder.
The
hasNext()
method determines if there are more files to iterate over.
The
next()
method retrieves the next file in the collection.
The
getContinuationToken()
method provides a token to resume iteration later.

get
Continuation
Token()
Gets a token that can be used to resume this iteration at a later time. This method is useful
if processing an iterator in one execution would exceed the maximum execution time.
Continuation tokens are generally valid for one week.
Return
String
— a continuation token that can be used to resume this iteration with the items that
    remained in the iterator when the token was generated
has
Next()
Determines whether calling
next()
will return an item.
Return
Boolean
—
true
if
next()
will return an item;
false
if not
next()
Gets the next item in the collection of files or folders. Throws an exception if no items
remain.
Return
File
— the next item in the collection
