ColorBuilder is a builder for creating color objects in Apps Script spreadsheets.
A new ColorBuilder is created using SpreadsheetApp.newColor().
The builder allows setting a color as either an RGB color using a CSS string or as a theme color using a ThemeColorType.
Once configured, the build() method creates the final Color object.
You can also convert a built color object to its RgbColor or ThemeColor representation and get its ColorType.
