Detailed documentation
get
Group
By
Email(email)
Retrieves the group having the specified email address. Throws an exception if the group does
not exist or if you do not have permission to see it.
Here is an example that gets a group by its email address and outputs whether the current
user is a member. Before running, replace the sample email address with a real group's email.
const
group
=
GroupsApp
.
getGroupByEmail
(
'example@googlegroups.com'
);
const
currentUser
=
Session
.
getActiveUser
();
if
(
group
.
hasUser
(
currentUser
))
{
Logger
.
log
(
'You are a member of this group.'
);
}
else
{
Logger
.
log
(
'You are not a member of this group.'
);
}
Parameters
Name

Description
email
String
The email address of the group to retrieve.

Authorization
Scripts that use this method require authorization with one or more of the following
scopes
:
https://www.googleapis.com/auth/groups
get
Groups()
Retrieves all the groups of which you are a direct member (or a pending member). This is an
empty list if you are not in any groups. Throws an exception if the group does not exist or if
you do not have permission to see it.
Here's an example of how to print the email address for every group the user belongs to:
function
showMyGroups
()
{
const
groups
=
GroupsApp
.
getGroups
();
let
str
=
`You are in
${
groups
.
length
}
groups: `
;
for
(
let
i
=
0
;
i
<
groups
.
length
;
i
++
)
{
const
group
=
groups
[
i
];
str
=
`
${
str
+
group
.
getEmail
()
}
`
;
}
Logger
.
log
(
str
);
}
Note that if you are a member of a group, B, which is itself a member of another group, A, then
you are
indirectly
subscribed to group A. Even though you receive copies of messages
sent to the "parent" group A, you are not actually subscribed to that group.
You can use
Group.getRole(email)
to determine if you are an existing or pending
member of the returned groups.
Return
Group[]
— The list of groups of which the user is a direct member.
