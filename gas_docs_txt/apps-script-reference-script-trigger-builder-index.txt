TriggerBuilder is a generic builder used for creating script triggers in Apps Script.
It provides methods to create trigger builders for specific Google services such as Documents, Forms, Spreadsheets, and Calendar.
TriggerBuilder also allows the creation of time-based triggers using the
timeBased()
method.
Each method returns a specialized builder for the respective service or time-based triggers.
Creating triggers requires appropriate authorization scopes depending on the service being used.
