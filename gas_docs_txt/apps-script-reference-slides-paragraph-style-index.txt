ParagraphStyle applies text styles to entire paragraphs.
Reading methods for ParagraphStyle return null if the TextRange spans paragraphs with different styles.
To avoid issues with reading styles across multiple paragraphs, query using the TextRange returned by Paragraph.getRange().
Editing text fit within a shape deactivates any autofit settings on paragraph styles.
ParagraphStyle provides methods to get and set indentation, line spacing, alignment, spacing above and below, spacing mode, and text direction.
Paragraph
Style
The styles of text that apply to entire paragraphs.
Read methods in this class return
null
if the corresponding
Text
Range
spans
multiple paragraphs, and those paragraphs have different values for the read method being called.
To avoid this, query for paragraph styles using the
Text
Range
returned by the
Paragraph.getRange()
method.
If you use methods that edit how text fits within a shape, any autofit settings applied to the
paragraph styles are deactivated.
