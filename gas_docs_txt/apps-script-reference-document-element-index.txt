Elements are generic representations of content within a Google Docs document.
Various specific content types, such as ListItem, Paragraph, and Table, are considered elements and inherit methods from the generic
Element
.
The content includes a table listing numerous classes that implement the generic Element, along with brief descriptions of what each represents within a document.
A table of methods is provided, showing different ways to interact with an Element, including casting it to a specific type, copying, retrieving attributes, and navigating the document structure.
Detailed documentation for several
as
methods demonstrates how to explicitly set an element's type for improved auto-completion and provides authorization scopes needed for these methods.
