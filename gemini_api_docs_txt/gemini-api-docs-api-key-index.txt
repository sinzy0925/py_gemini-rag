To use the Gemini API, you need an API key. This page outlines how to create and
manage your keys in Google AI Studio as well as how to set up your environment
to use them in your code.
API Keys
An
API key
is an
encrypted string that you can use when calling Google Cloud APIs.
You can create and manage all your Gemini API Keys from the
Google AI Studio
API Keys
page.
Once you have an API key, you have the following options to connect to the
Gemini API:
Setting your API key as an environment variable
Providing your API key explicitly
For initial testing, you can hard code an API key, but this should only be
temporary since it's not secure. You can find examples for hard coding the API
key in
Providing API key explicitly
section.
Google Cloud projects
Google Cloud projects
are fundamental to using Google Cloud services (such as the Gemini API),
managing billing, and controlling collaborators and permissions. Google AI
Studio provides a lightweight interface to your Google Cloud projects.
If you don't have
any projects created yet, you must either create a new project or import one
from Google Cloud into Google AI Studio. The
Projects
page in Google AI
Studio will display all keys that have sufficient permission to use the Gemini
API. Refer to the
import projects
section for instructions.
Default project
For new users, after accepting Terms of Service, Google AI Studio creates a
default Google Cloud Project and API Key, for ease of use. You can rename this
project in Google AI Studio by navigating to
Projects
view in the
Dashboard
, clicking the 3 dots settings button next to a project and
choosing
Rename project
. Existing users, or users who already have Google
Cloud Accounts won't have a default project created.
Import projects
Each Gemini API key is associated with a Google Cloud project. By default,
Google AI Studio does not show all of your Cloud Projects. You must import the
projects you want by searching for the name or project ID in the
Import Projects
dialog. To view a complete list of projects you have access
to, visit the Cloud Console.
If you don't have any projects imported yet, follow these steps to import a
Google Cloud project and create a key:
Go to
Google AI Studio
.
Open the
Dashboard
from the left side panel.
Select
Projects
.
Select the
Import projects
button in the
Projects
page.
Search for and select the Google Cloud project you want to import and select
the
Import
button.
Once a project is imported, go to the
API Keys
page from the
Dashboard
menu and create an API key in the project you just imported.
Note:
For existing users, the keys are pre-populated in the imports pane based
      on the last 30-days of activity in AI Studio.
Limitations
The following are limitations of managing API keys and Google Cloud projects in
Google AI Studio.
You can create a maximum of 10 project at a time from the Google AI Studio
Projects
page.
You can name and rename projects and keys.
The
API keys
and
Projects
pages display a maximum of 100 keys and
50 projects.
Only API keys that have no restrictions, or are restricted to the Generative
Language API are displayed.
For additional management access to your projects, visit the Google Cloud Console.
Setting the API key as an environment variable
If you set the environment variable
GEMINI_API_KEY
or
GOOGLE_API_KEY
, the
API key will automatically be picked up by the client when using one of the
Gemini API libraries
. It's recommended that you
set only one of those variables, but if both are set,
GOOGLE_API_KEY
takes
precedence.
If you're using the REST API, or JavaScript on the browser, you will need to
provide the API key explicitly.
Here is how you can set your API key locally as the environment variable
GEMINI_API_KEY
with different operating systems.
Linux/macOS - Bash
Bash is a common Linux and macOS terminal configuration. You can check if
you have a configuration file for it by running the following command:
~/.bashrc
If the response is "No such file or directory", you will need to create this
file and open it by running the following commands, or use
zsh
:
touch
~/.bashrc
open
~/.bashrc
Next, you need to set your API key by adding the following export command:
export
GEMINI_API_KEY
=
<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>
After saving the file, apply the changes by running:
source
~/.bashrc
macOS - Zsh
Zsh is a common Linux and macOS terminal configuration. You can check if
you have a configuration file for it by running the following command:
~/.zshrc
If the response is "No such file or directory", you will need to create this
file and open it by running the following commands, or use
bash
:
touch
~/.zshrc
open
~/.zshrc
Next, you need to set your API key by adding the following export command:
export
GEMINI_API_KEY
=
<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>
After saving the file, apply the changes by running:
source
~/.zshrc
Windows
Search for "Environment Variables" in the search bar.
Choose to modify
System Settings
. You may have to confirm you want to
do this.
In the system settings dialog, click the button labeled
Environment
Variables
.
Under either
User variables
(for the current user) or
System
variables
(applies to all users who use the machine), click
New...
Specify the variable name as
GEMINI_API_KEY
. Specify your Gemini API
Key as the variable value.
Click
OK
to apply the changes.
Open a new terminal session (cmd or Powershell) to get the new variable.
Providing the API key explicitly
In some cases, you may want to explicitly provide an API key. For example:
You're doing a simple API call and prefer hard coding the API key.
You want explicit control without having to rely on automatic discovery of
environment variables by the Gemini API libraries
You're using an environment where environment variables are not supported
(e.g web) or you are making REST calls.
Below are examples for how you can provide an API key explicitly:

Keep your API key secure
Treat your Gemini API key like a password. If compromised, others can use your
project's quota, incur charges (if billing is enabled), and access your
private data, such as files.
Critical security rules
Never commit API keys to source control.
Do not check your API key into version control systems like Git.
Never expose API keys on the client-side.
Do not use your API key directly
in web or mobile apps in production. Keys in client-side code
(including our JavaScript/TypeScript libraries and REST calls) can be
extracted.
Best practices
Use server-side calls with API keys
The most secure way to use your API
key is to call the Gemini API from a server-side application where the key
can be kept confidential.
Use ephemeral tokens for client-side access (Live API only):
For direct
client-side access to the Live API, you can use ephemeral tokens. They come with
lower security risks and can be suitable for production use. Review
ephemeral tokens
guide for more information.
Consider adding restrictions to your key:
You can limit a key's permissions
by adding
API key restrictions
.
This minimizes the potential damage if the key is ever leaked.
