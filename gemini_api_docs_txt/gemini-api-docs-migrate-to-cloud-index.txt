When developing generative AI solutions with Gemini, Google offers two API products:
the
Gemini Developer API
and the
Vertex AI Gemini API
.
The Gemini Developer API provides the fastest path to build, productionize, and
scale Gemini powered applications. Most developers should use the Gemini Developer
API unless there is a need for specific enterprise controls.
Vertex AI offers a comprehensive ecosystem of enterprise ready features and services
for building and deploying generative AI applications backed by the Google Cloud Platform.
We've recently simplified migrating between these services. Both the Gemini
Developer API and the Vertex AI Gemini API are now accessible through the unified
Google Gen AI SDK
.
Code comparison
This page has side-by-side code comparisons between Gemini Developer API and
Vertex AI quickstarts for text generation.
Python
You can access both the Gemini Developer API and Vertex AI services through
the
google-genai
library. See the
libraries
page
for instructions on how to install
google-genai
.

Other use cases and platforms
Refer to use case specific guides on
Gemini Developer API Documentation
and
Vertex AI documentation
for other platforms and use cases.
Migration considerations
When you migrate:
You'll need to use Google Cloud service accounts to authenticate. See the
Vertex AI documentation
for more information.
You can use your existing Google Cloud project
(the same one you used to generate your API key) or you can
create a new Google Cloud project
.
Supported regions may differ between the Gemini Developer API and the
Vertex AI Gemini API. See the list of
supported regions for generative AI on Google Cloud
.
Any models you created in Google AI Studio need to be retrained in Vertex AI.
If you no longer need to use your Gemini API key for the Gemini Developer API,
then follow security best practices and delete it.
To delete an API key:
Open the
Google Cloud API Credentials
page.
Find the API key you want to delete and click the
Actions
icon.
Select
Delete API key
.
In the
Delete credential
modal, select
Delete
.
Deleting an API key takes a few minutes to propagate. After
propagation completes, any traffic using the deleted API key is rejected.
Important:
If you have deleted a key that is still used in production and need
to recover it, see
gcloud beta services api-keys undelete
.
