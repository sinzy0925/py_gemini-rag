The Gemini API can transform text input into single speaker or multi-speaker
audio using native text-to-speech (TTS) generation capabilities.
Text-to-speech (TTS) generation is
controllable
,
meaning you can use natural language to structure interactions and guide the
style
,
accent
,
pace
, and
tone
of the audio.
The TTS capability differs from speech generation provided through the
Live API
, which is designed for interactive,
unstructured audio, and multimodal inputs and outputs. While the Live API excels
in dynamic conversational contexts, TTS through the Gemini API
is tailored for scenarios that require exact text recitation with fine-grained
control over style and sound, such as podcast or audiobook generation.
This guide shows you how to generate single-speaker and multi-speaker audio from
text.
Preview:
Native text-to-speech (TTS) is in
Preview
.
Before you begin
Ensure you use a Gemini 2.5 model variant with native text-to-speech (TTS) capabilities, as listed in the
Supported models
section. For optimal results, consider which model best fits your specific use case.
You may find it useful to
test the Gemini 2.5 TTS models in AI Studio
before you start building.
Note:
TTS models accept text-only inputs and produce audio-only outputs. For a complete list of restrictions specific to TTS models, review the
Limitations
section.
Single-speaker text-to-speech
To convert text to single-speaker audio, set the response modality to "audio",
and pass a
SpeechConfig
object with
VoiceConfig
set.
You'll need to choose a voice name from the prebuilt
output voices
.
This example saves the output audio from the model in a wave file:
Python
from
google
import
genai
from
google.genai
import
types
import
wave
# Set up the wave file to save the output:
def
wave_file
(
filename

For multi-speaker audio, you'll need a
MultiSpeakerVoiceConfig

each speaker (up to 2) configured as a

.
You'll need to define each
speaker
with the same names used in the

Controlling speech style with prompts
You can control style, tone, accent, and pace using natural language prompts
for both single- and multi-speaker TTS.
For example, in a single-speaker prompt, you can say:
Say in an spooky whisper:
"By the pricking of my thumbs...
Something wicked this way comes"
In a multi-speaker prompt, provide the model with each speaker's name and
corresponding transcript. You can also provide guidance for each speaker
individually:
Make Speaker1 sound tired and bored, and Speaker2 sound excited and happy:

Speaker1: So... what's on the agenda today?
Speaker2: You're never going to guess!
Try using a
voice option
that corresponds to the style or emotion you
want to convey, to emphasize it even more. In the previous prompt, for example,
Enceladus
's breathiness might emphasize "tired" and "bored", while
Puck
's upbeat tone could complement "excited" and "happy".
Generating a prompt to convert to audio
The TTS models only output audio, but you can use
other models
to generate a transcript first,
then pass that transcript to the TTS model to read aloud.
