With the deprecation of Gemini 1.5 Flash-001 in May 2025, we no longer have a
model available which supports fine-tuning in the Gemini API, but it is supported
in
Vertex AI
.
We plan to bring fine-tuning support back in the future. We would love to
hear
from you on our developer forum
if
fine-tuning is important to your use case.
