The easiest way to authenticate to the Gemini API is to configure an API key, as
described in the
Gemini API quickstart
. If you
need stricter access controls, you can use OAuth instead. This guide will help
you set up authentication with OAuth.
This guide uses a simplified authentication approach that is appropriate
for a testing environment. For a production environment, learn
about
authentication and authorization
before
choosing the access credentials
that are appropriate for your app.
Objectives
Set up your cloud project for OAuth
Set up application-default-credentials
Manage credentials in your program instead of using
gcloud auth
Prerequisites
To run this quickstart, you need:
A Google Cloud project
A local installation of the gcloud CLI
Set up your cloud project
To complete this quickstart, you first need to setup your Cloud project.
1. Enable the API
Before using Google APIs, you need to turn them on in a Google Cloud project.
In the Google Cloud console, enable the Google Generative Language API.
Enable the API
2. Configure the OAuth consent screen
Next configure the project's OAuth consent screen and add yourself as a test
user. If you've already completed this step for your Cloud project, skip to the
next section.
In the Google Cloud console, go to
Menu
>
Google Auth platform
>
Overview
.
Go to the Google Auth platform
Complete the project configuration form and set the user type to
External
in the
Audience
section.
Complete the rest of the form, accept the User Data Policy terms, and then
click
Create
.
For now, you can skip adding scopes and click
Save and Continue
. In the
future, when you create an app for use outside of your Google Workspace
organization, you must add and verify the authorization scopes that your
app requires.
Add test users:
Navigate to the
Audience page
of the
Google Auth platform.
Under
Test users
, click
Add users
.
Enter your email address and any other authorized test users, then
click
Save
.
3. Authorize credentials for a desktop application
To authenticate as an end user and access user data in your app, you need to
create one or more OAuth 2.0 Client IDs. A client ID is used to identify a
single app to Google's OAuth servers. If your app runs on multiple platforms,
you must create a separate client ID for each platform.
In the Google Cloud console, go to
Menu
>
Google Auth platform
>
Clients
.
Go to Credentials
Click
Create Client
.
Click
Application type
>
Desktop app
.
In the
Name
field, type a name for the credential. This name is only
shown in the Google Cloud console.
Click
Create
. The OAuth client created screen appears, showing your new
Client ID and Client secret.
Click
OK
. The newly created credential appears under
OAuth 2.0 Client
IDs.
Click the download button to save the JSON file. It will be saved as
client_secret_<identifier>.json
, and rename it to
client_secret.json
and move it to your working directory.
Set up Application Default Credentials
To convert the
client_secret.json
file into usable credentials, pass its
location the
gcloud auth application-default login
command's
--client-id-file
argument.
gcloud
auth
application-default
login
\
--client-id-file
=
client_secret.json
\
--scopes
=
'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/generative-language.retriever'
The simplified project setup in this tutorial triggers a
"Google hasn't
verified this app."
dialog. This is normal, choose
"continue"
.
This places the resulting token in a well known location so it can be accessed
by
gcloud
or the client libraries.
Note:
If running on Colab include
--no-browser
and carefully follow the
instructions it prints (don't just click the link). Also make sure your local
gcloud --version
is the
latest
to match Colab.
gcloud auth application-default login
--no-browser
--client-id-file=client_secret.json
--scopes='https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/generative-language.retriever'
Once you have the Application Default Credentials (ADC) set, the client
libraries in most languages need minimal to no help to find them.
Curl
The quickest way to test that this is working is to use it to access the REST
API using curl:
access_token
=
$(
gcloud
auth
application-default
print-access-token
)
project_id
=
<MY
PROJECT
ID>
curl
-X
GET
https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1/models
\
-H
'Content-Type: application/json'
\
-H
"Authorization: Bearer
${
access_token
}
"
\
-H
"x-goog-user-project:
${
project_id
}
"
|
grep
'"name"'
Python
In python the client libraries should find them automatically:
pip
install
google-generativeai
A minimal script to test it might be:
import
google.generativeai
as
genai
print
(
'Available base models:'
,
[
m
.
name
for
m
in
genai
.
list_models
()])
Next steps
If that's working you're ready to try
Semantic retrieval on your text data
.
Manage credentials yourself [Python]
In many cases you won't have the
gcloud
command available to create the access
token from the Client ID (
client_secret.json
). Google provides libraries in
many languages to let you manage that process within your app. This section
demonstrates the process, in python. There are equivalent examples of this sort
of procedure, for other languages, available in the
Drive API documentation
1. Install the necessary libraries
Install the Google client library for Python, and the Gemini client library.
pip
install
--upgrade
-q
google-api-python-client
google-auth-httplib2
google-auth-oauthlib
pip
install
google-generativeai
2. Write the credential manager
To minimize the number of times you have to click through the authorization
screens, create a file called
load_creds.py
in your working directory to
caches a
token.json
file that it can reuse later, or refresh if it expires.
Start with the
following code to convert the
client_secret.json
file to a token usable with
genai.configure
:
import
os.path
from
google.auth.transport.requests
import
Request
from
google.oauth2.credentials
import
Credentials
from
google_auth_oauthlib.flow
import
InstalledAppFlow
SCOPES
=
[
'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/generative-language.retriever'
]
def
load_creds
():
"""Converts `client_secret.json` to a credential object.
This function caches the generated tokens to minimize the use of the
consent screen.
"""
creds
=
None
# The file token.json stores the user's access and refresh tokens, and is
# created automatically when the authorization flow completes for the first
# time.
if
os
.
path
.
exists
(
'token.json'
):
creds
=
Credentials
.
from_authorized_user_file
(
'token.json'
,
SCOPES
)
# If there are no (valid) credentials available, let the user log in.
if
not
creds
or
not
creds
.
valid
:
if
creds
and
creds
.
expired
and
creds
.
refresh_token
:
creds
.
refresh
(
Request
())
else
:
flow
=
InstalledAppFlow
.
from_client_secrets_file
(
'client_secret.json'
,
SCOPES
)
creds
=
flow
.
run_local_server
(
port
=
0
)
# Save the credentials for the next run
with
open
(
'token.json'
,
'w'
)
as
token
:
token
.
write
(
creds
.
to_json
())
return
creds
3. Write your program
Now create your
script.py
:
import
pprint
import
google.generativeai
as
genai
from
load_creds
import
load_creds
creds
=
load_creds
()
genai
.
configure
(
credentials
=
creds
)
print
()
print
(
'Available base models:'
,
[
m
.
name
for
m
in
genai
.
list_models
()])
4. Run your program
In your working directory, run the sample:
python
script.py
The first time you run the script, it opens a browser window and prompts you
to authorize access.
If you're not already signed in to your Google Account, you're prompted to
sign in. If you're signed in to multiple accounts,
be sure to select the
account you set as a "Test Account" when configuring your project.
Note:
The simplified project setup in this tutorial triggers a
"Google
hasn't verified this app."
dialog. This is normal, choose
"continue"
.
Authorization information is stored in the file system, so the next time you
run the sample code, you aren't prompted for authorization.
You have successfully setup authentication.
