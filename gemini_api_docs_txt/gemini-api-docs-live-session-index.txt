In the Live API, a session refers to a persistent
connection where input and output are streamed continuously over the same
connection (read more about
how it works
).
This unique session design enables low latency and supports unique features, but
can also introduce challenges, like session time limits, and early termination.
This guide covers strategies for overcoming the session management challenges
that can arise when using the Live API.
Session lifetime
Without compression, audio-only sessions are limited to 15 minutes,
and audio-video sessions are limited to 2 minutes. Exceeding these limits
will terminate the session (and therefore, the connection), but you can use
context window compression
to extend sessions to
an unlimited amount of time.
The lifetime of a connection is limited as well, to around 10 minutes. When the
connection terminates, the session terminates as well. In this case, you can
configure a single session to stay active over multiple connections using
session resumption
.
You'll also receive a
GoAway message
before the
connection ends, allowing you to take further actions.
Context window compression
To enable longer sessions, and avoid abrupt connection termination, you can
enable context window compression by setting the
contextWindowCompression
field as part of the session configuration.
In the
ContextWindowCompressionConfig
, you can configure a
sliding-window mechanism
and the
number of tokens
that triggers compression.

JavaScript
const
config
=
{
responseModalities
:
[
Modality
.
AUDIO
],
contextWindowCompression
:
{
slidingWindow
:
{}
}
};
Session resumption
To prevent session termination when the server periodically resets the WebSocket
connection, configure the
sessionResumption
field within the
setup configuration
.
Passing this configuration causes the
server to send
SessionResumptionUpdate
messages, which can be used to resume the session by passing the last resumption
token as the
SessionResumptionConfig.handle
of the subsequent connection.
Resumption tokens are valid for 2 hr after the last sessions termination.

Receiving a message before the session disconnects
The server sends a
GoAway
message that signals that the current
connection will soon be terminated. This message includes the
timeLeft
,
indicating the remaining time and lets you take further action before the
connection will be terminated as ABORTED.
Python
async
for
response
in
session
.
receive
():
if
response
.
go_away
is
not
None
:
# The connection will soon be terminated
print
(
response
.
go_away
.
time_left
)
JavaScript
const
turns
=
await
handleTurn
();
for
(
const
turn
of
turns
)
{
if
(
turn
.
goAway
)
{
console
.
debug
(
'Time left: %s\n'
,
turn
.
goAway
.
timeLeft
);
}
}
Receiving a message when the generation is complete
The server sends a
generationComplete
message that signals that the model finished generating the response.
Python
async
for
response
in
session
.
receive
():
if
response
.
server_content
.
generation_complete
is
True
:
# The generation is complete
JavaScript
const
turns
=
await
handleTurn
();
for
(
const
turn
of
turns
)
{
if
(
turn
.
serverContent
&&
turn
.
serverContent
.
generationComplete
)
{
// The generation is complete
}
}
