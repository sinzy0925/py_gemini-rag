Grounding with Google Maps connects the generative capabilities of Gemini with
the rich, factual, and up-to-date data of Google Maps. This feature enables
developers to easily incorporate location-aware functionality into their
applications. When a user query has a context related to Maps data, the Gemini
model leverages Google Maps to provide factually accurate and fresh answers that
are relevant to the user's specified location or general area.
Accurate, location-aware responses:
Leverage Google Maps' extensive and
current data for geographically specific queries.
Enhanced personalization:
Tailor recommendations and information based
on user-provided locations.
Contextual information and widgets:
Context tokens to render interactive
Google Maps widgets alongside generated content.
Get started
This example demonstrates how to integrate Grounding with Google Maps into your
application to provide accurate, location-aware responses to user queries. The
prompt asks for local recommendations with an optional user location, enabling
the Gemini model to leverage Google Maps data.

How Grounding with Google Maps works
Grounding with Google Maps integrates the Gemini API with the Google Geo
ecosystem by using the Maps API as a grounding source. When a user's query
contains geographical context, the Gemini model can invoke the Grounding with
Google Maps tool. The model can then generate responses grounded in Google Maps
data relevant to the provided location.
The process typically involves:
User query:
A user submits a query to your application, potentially
including geographical context (e.g., "coffee shops near me," "museums in
San Francisco").
Tool invocation:
The Gemini model, recognizing the geographical intent,
invokes the Grounding with Google Maps tool. This tool can optionally be
provided with the user's
latitude
and
longitude
. The tool is a textual
search tool and behaves similarly to searching on Maps, in that local
queries ("near me") will use the coordinates, while specific or non-local
queries are unlikely to be influenced by the explicit location.
Data retrieval:
The Grounding with Google Maps service queries Google
Maps for relevant information (e.g., places, reviews, photos, addresses,
opening hours).
Grounded generation:
The retrieved Maps data is used to inform the
Gemini model's response, ensuring factual accuracy and relevance.
Response & widget token:
The model returns a text response, which
includes citations to Google Maps sources. Optionally, the API response may
also contain a
google_maps_widget_context_token
, allowing developers to
render a contextual Google Maps widget in their application for visual
interaction.
Why and when to use Grounding with Google Maps
Grounding with Google Maps is ideal for applications that require accurate,
up-to-date, and location-specific information. It enhances the user experience
by providing relevant and personalized content backed by Google Maps' extensive
database of over 250 million places worldwide.
You should use Grounding with Google Maps when your application needs to:
Provide complete and accurate responses to geo-specific questions.
Build conversational trip planners and local guides.
Recommend points of interest based on
location and user preferences like restaurants or shops.
Create location-aware experiences for social, retail, or food delivery
services.
Grounding with Google Maps excels in use cases where proximity and current
factual data are critical, such as finding the "best coffee shop near me" or
getting directions.
API methods and parameters
Grounding with Google Maps is exposed through the Gemini API as a tool within
the
generateContent
method. You enable and configure
Grounding with Google Maps by including a
googleMaps
object in the
tools
parameter of your
request.
JSON
{
"contents"
:
[{
"parts"
:
[
{
"text"
:
"Restaurants near Times Square."
}
]
}],
"tools"
:
{
"googleMaps"
:
{}
}
}
The
googleMaps
tool can additionally accept a boolean
enableWidget
parameter, that is used to control whether the
googleMapsWidgetContextToken
field is returned in the response. This can be used to display a
contextual Places widget
.

}],
"tools"

{
"googleMaps"
:
{
"enableWidget"
:

}
}
}
Additionally, the tool supports passing the contextual location as
toolConfig
.

}
Understanding the grounding response
When a response is successfully grounded with Google Maps data, the response
includes a
groundingMetadata
field.
This structured data is essential for verifying claims and building a rich
citation experience in your application, as well as meeting the service usage
requirements.
JSON
{
"candidates"
:
[
{
"content"
:
{
"parts"
:
[
{
"text"
:
"CanteenM is an American restaurant with..."
}
],
"role"
:
"model"
},
"groundingMetadata"
:
{
"groundingChunks"
:
[
{
"maps"
:
{
"uri"
:
"https://maps.google.com/?cid=13100894621228039586"
,
"title"
:
"Heaven on 7th Marketplace"
,
"placeId"
:
"places/ChIJ0-zA1vBZwokRon0fGj-6z7U"
},
// repeated ...
}
],
"groundingSupports"
:
[
{
"segment"
:
{
"startIndex"
:
0
,
"endIndex"
:
79
,
"text"
:
"CanteenM is an American restaurant with a 4.6-star rating and is open 24 hours."
},
"groundingChunkIndices"
:
[
0
]
},
// repeated ...
],
"webSearchQueries"
:
[
"restaurants near me"
],
"googleMapsWidgetContextToken"
:
"widgetcontent/..."
}
}
]
}
The Gemini API returns the following information with the
groundingMetadata
:
groundingChunks
: Array of objects containing the
maps
sources (
uri
,
placeId
and
title
).
groundingSupports
: Array of chunks to connect model response text to the
sources in
groundingChunks
. Each chunk links a text span (defined by
startIndex
and
endIndex
) to one or more
groundingChunkIndices
. This is
the key to building inline citations.
googleMapsWidgetContextToken
: A text token that can be used to render a
contextual Places
widget
.
For a code snippet showing how to render inline citations in text, see
the
example
in the Grounding with Google Search docs.
Display the Google Maps contextual widget
To use the returned
googleMapsWidgetContextToken
, you need to
load the
Google Maps JavaScript
API
.
Use cases
Grounding with Google Maps supports a variety of location-aware use cases. The
following examples demonstrate how different prompts and parameters can leverage
Grounding with Google Maps. Information in the Google Maps Grounded Results may
differ from actual conditions.

Service usage requirements
This section describes the service usage requirements for Grounding with Google
Maps.
Inform the user about the use of Google Maps sources
With each Google Maps Grounded Result, you'll receive sources in
groundingChunks
that support each response. The following metadata is also returned:
source uri
title
ID
When presenting results from Grounding with Google Maps, you must specify the
associated Google Maps sources, and inform your users of the following:
The Google Maps sources must immediately follow the generated content that
the sources support. This generated content is also referred to as Google
Maps Grounded Result.
The Google Maps sources must be viewable within one user interaction.
Display Google Maps sources with Google Maps links
For each source in
groundingChunks
and in
grounding_chunks.maps.placeAnswerSources.reviewSnippets
, a link preview must be
generated following these requirements:
Attribute each source to Google Maps following the Google Maps text
attribution guidelines
.
Display the source title provided in the response.
Link to the source using the
uri
or
googleMapsUri
from the response.
These images show the minimum requirements for displaying the sources and Google
Maps links.
You can collapse the view of the sources.
Optional: Enhance the link preview with additional content, such as:
A
Google Maps favicon
is inserted before the Google Maps text attribution.

Best practices
Provide user location:
For the most relevant and personalized responses,
always include the
user_location
(latitude and longitude) in your
googleMapsGrounding
configuration when the user's location is known.
Render the Google Maps contextual widget:
The contextual widget is
rendered using the context token,
googleMapsWidgetContextToken
, which is
returned in the Gemini API response and can be used to render visual content
from Google Maps. For more information on the contextual widget, see
Grounding with Google Maps
widget
in the Google Developer Guide.
Inform End-Users:
Clearly inform your end-users that Google Maps
data is being used to answer their queries, especially when the tool is
enabled.
Monitor Latency:
For conversational applications, ensure that the P95
latency for grounded responses remains within acceptable thresholds to
maintain a smooth user experience.
Toggle Off When Not Needed:
Grounding with Google Maps is off by
default. Only enable it (
"tools": [{"googleMaps": {}}]
) when a query has a
clear geographical context, to optimize performance and cost.
Limitations
Geographical Scope:
Currently, Grounding with Google Maps is globally
available
Model Support:
Only specific Gemini models support Grounding with Google
Maps: Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini
2.0 Flash (but not 2.0 Flash Lite).
Multimodal Inputs/Outputs:
Grounding with Google Maps does not currently
support multimodal inputs or outputs beyond text and contextual map widgets.
Default State:
The Grounding with Google Maps tool is off by default.
You must explicitly enable it in your API requests.
Pricing and rate limits
Grounding with Google Maps pricing is based on queries. The current rate is
$25 / 1K grounded prompts
. The free tier also has up to 500 requests per day
available. A request is only counted towards the quota when
a prompt successfully returns at least one Google Maps grounded result (i.e.,
results containing at least one Google Maps source). If multiple queries are
sent to Google Maps from a single request, it counts as one request towards the
rate limit.
Note:
The quota for Grounding with Google Maps typically aligns with the underlying Gemini model rate limits.
For detailed pricing information, see the
Gemini API pricing page
