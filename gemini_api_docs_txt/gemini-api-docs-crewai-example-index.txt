CrewAI
is a framework for orchestrating
autonomous AI agents that collaborate to achieve complex goals. It lets you
define agents by specifying roles, goals, and backstories, and then define tasks
for them.
This example demonstrates how to build a multi-agent system for analyzing
customer support data to identify issues and propose process improvements using
Gemini 2.5 Pro, generating a report intended to be read by a Chief Operating
Officer (COO).
The guide will show you how to create a "crew" of AI agents that can do the
following tasks:
Fetch and analyze customer support data (simulated in this example).
Identify recurring problems and process bottlenecks.
Suggest actionable improvements.
Compile the findings into a concise report suitable for a COO.
You need a Gemini API key. If you don't already have one, you can
get one in
Google AI Studio
.
pip
install
"crewai[tools]"
Set your Gemini API key as an environment variable named
GEMINI_API_KEY
, then
configure CrewAI to use the Gemini 2.5 Pro model.
import
os
from
crewai
import
LLM
# Read your API key from the environment variable
gemini_api_key
=
os
.
getenv
(
"GEMINI_API_KEY"
)
# Use Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental model
gemini_llm
=
LLM
(
model
=
'gemini/gemini-2.5-pro'
,
api_key
=
gemini_api_key
,
temperature
=
0.0
# Lower temperature for more consistent results.
)
Define components
CrewAI applications are built using
Tools
,
Agents
,
Tasks
, and the
Crew
itself. Each of these is explained in the following sections.
Tools
Tools are capabilities that agents can use to interact with the outside world or
perform specific actions. Here, you define a placeholder tool to simulate
fetching customer support data. In a real application, you would connect to a
database, API or file system. For more information on tools, see the
CrewAI
tools guide
.
from
crewai.tools
import
BaseTool
# Placeholder tool for fetching customer support data
class
CustomerSupportDataTool
(
BaseTool
):

:
str
=
"Customer Support Data Fetcher"
description
:

"Fetches recent customer support interactions, tickets, and feedback. "
"Returns a summary string."
)
def

)

str
:
# In a real scenario, this would query a database or API.
# For this example, return simulated data.
print
(
f
"--- Fetching data for query:

}
---"
)
return
(
"""Recent Support Data Summary:
- 50 tickets related to 'login issues'. High resolution time (avg 48h).
- 30 tickets about 'billing discrepancies'. Mostly resolved within 12h.
- 20 tickets on 'feature requests'. Often closed without resolution.
- Frequent feedback mentions 'confusing user interface' for password reset.
- High volume of calls related to 'account verification process'.
- Sentiment analysis shows growing frustration with 'login issues' resolution time.
- Support agent notes indicate difficulty reproducing 'login issues'."""

Agents
Agents are the individual AI workers in your crew. Each agent has a specific
role
,
goal
,
backstory
, assigned
llm
, and optional
tools
. For more
information on agents, see the
CrewAI agents
guide
.

Tasks
Tasks define the specific assignments for the agents. Each task has a
description
,
expected_output
, and is assigned to an
agent
. Tasks are run
sequentially by default and include the context of the previous task. For more
information on tasks, see the
CrewAI tasks
guide
.
from

and impact (e.g., resolution time, customer sentiment). Use the Customer Support Data Fetcher tool."""
),
expected_output
=
(
"""A summary report detailing the key findings from the customer support data analysis, including:
- Top 3-5 recurring issues with frequency.
- Average resolution times for these issues.
- Key customer pain points mentioned in feedback.
- Any notable trends in sentiment or support agent observations."""

),

2. The key process bottlenecks causing these issues.
3. The recommended process improvements.
Ensure the report is easy to understand, focuses on actionable insights, and is formatted professionally."""
),
expected_output
=
(

underlying process bottlenecks, and clear, actionable recommendations for the COO.

),
agent
=
report_writer
# Assign task to the report_writer agent
)
Crew
The
Crew
brings the agents and tasks together, defining the workflow process
(such as "sequential").
from
crewai
import
Crew
,
Process
# Define the crew with agents, tasks, and process
support_analysis_crew
=
Crew
(
agents
=
[
data_analyst
,
process_optimizer
,
report_writer
],
tasks
=
[
analysis_task
,
optimization_task
,
report_task
],
process
=
Process
.
sequential
,
# Tasks will run sequentially in the order defined
verbose
=
True
)
Run the Crew
Finally, kick off the crew execution with any necessary inputs.
# Start the crew's work
print
(
"--- Starting Customer Support Analysis Crew ---"
)
# The 'inputs' dictionary provides initial context if needed by the first task.
# In this case, the tool simulates data fetching regardless of the input.
result
=
support_analysis_crew
.
kickoff
(
inputs
=
{
'data_query'
:
'last quarter support data'
})
print
(
"--- Crew Execution Finished ---"
)
print
(
"--- Final Report for COO ---"
)
print
(
result
)
The script will now execute. The
Data Analyst
will use the tool, the
Process
Optimizer
will analyze the findings, and the
Report Writer
will compile the
final report, which is then printed to the console. The
verbose=True
setting
will show the detailed thought process and actions of each agent.
