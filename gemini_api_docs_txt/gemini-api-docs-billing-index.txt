Upgrade to the Gemini API paid tier
About billing
Billing for the Gemini API is based on two pricing tiers:
free of charge
(or
free
) and
pay-as-you-go
(or
paid
). Pricing and rate limits differ
between these tiers and also vary by model. You can check out the
rate limits
and
pricing
pages for more into. For a model-by-model
breakdown of capabilities, see the
Gemini models page
.
How to request an upgrade
To transition from the free tier to the pay-as-you-go plan, you need to
enable billing for your Google Cloud project. The button you see in
Google AI Studio depends on your project's current plan.
If you're on the free tier, you'll see a
Set up Billing
button for
your project.
If you're already on the paid tier and meet the criteria for a plan change,
you might see an
Upgrade
button.
To start the process, follow these steps:
Go to the
AI Studio API keys page
.
Find the project you want to move to the paid plan and click either
Set up Billing
or
Upgrade
, depending on the button displayed.
The next step depends on the button you clicked:
If you clicked Set up Billing:
You'll be redirected to the
Google Cloud console to link a billing account to your project.
Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process.
If you clicked Upgrade:
The system will automatically verify
your project's eligibility. If your project meets all the
requirements, it will be instantly upgraded to the next tier.
Why use the paid tier?
When you enable billing and use the paid tier, you benefit from
higher rate limits
,
and your prompts and responses aren't used to improve Google products.

terms of service

Cloud Billing
for billing services. To use the paid tier, you must set up Cloud Billing on
your cloud project. After you've enabled Cloud Billing, you can use Cloud
Billing tools to track spending, understand costs, make payments, and access
Cloud Billing support.

Open
Google AI Studio

In the bottom of the left sidebar, select
Settings

Click
Set up Billing
