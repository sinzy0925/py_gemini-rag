This document provides a high-level overview of the differences between the
v1
and
v1beta
versions of the Gemini API.
v1
: Stable version of the API. Features in the stable version are
fully-supported over the lifetime of the major version. If there are any
breaking changes, then the next major version of the API will be created and
the existing version will be deprecated after a reasonable period of time.
Non-breaking changes may be introduced to the API without changing the major
version.
v1beta
: This version includes early-access features that may be under
development and is subject to rapid and breaking changes. There is also no
guarantee that the features in the Beta version will move to the stable
version. Due to this instability, you should consider not launching production
applications with this version.
