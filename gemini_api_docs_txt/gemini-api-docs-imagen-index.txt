Imagen is Google's high-fidelity image generation model, capable of generating
realistic and high quality images from text prompts. All generated images
include a SynthID watermark. To learn more about the available Imagen model
variants, see the
Model versions
section.
Note:
You can also generate images with Gemini's built-in multimodal
capabilities. See the
Image generation
guide
for details.

Imagen prompt guide
This section of the Imagen guide shows you how modifying a text-to-image prompt
can produce different results, along with examples of images you can create.
Prompt writing basics
Note:
Maximum prompt length is 480 tokens.
A good prompt is descriptive and clear, and makes use of meaningful keywords and
modifiers. Start by thinking of your
subject
,
context
, and
style
.
Image text: A
sketch
(
style
) of a
modern apartment building
(
subject
) surrounded by
skyscrapers
(
context and background
).
Subject
: The first thing to think about with any prompt is the
subject
: the object, person, animal, or scenery you want an image of.
Context and background:
Just as important is the
background or context
in which the subject will be placed. Try placing your subject in a variety
of backgrounds. For example, a studio with a white background, outdoors, or
indoor environments.
Style:
Finally, add the style of image you want.
Styles
can be general
(painting, photograph, sketches) or very specific (pastel painting, charcoal
drawing, isometric 3D). You can also combine styles.
After you write a first version of your prompt, refine your prompt by adding
more details until you get to the image that you want. Iteration is important.
Start by establishing your core idea, and then refine and expand upon that core
idea until the generated image is close to your vision.
Prompt: A park in the spring next to a lake
Prompt: A park in the spring next to a lake,
the sun sets across the lake, golden hour
Prompt: A park in the spring next to a lake,
the sun sets across the lake, golden hour, red wildflowers
Imagen models can transform your ideas into detailed images, whether
your prompts are short or long and detailed. Refine your vision
through iterative prompting, adding details until you achieve the perfect
result.
Short prompts let you generate an image quickly.
Prompt: close-up photo of a woman in her 20s, street photography,
        movie still, muted orange warm tones
Longer prompts let you add specific details and build your image.
Prompt: captivating photo of a woman in her 20s utilizing a street
        photography style. The image should look like a movie still with muted orange
        warm tones.
Additional advice for Imagen prompt writing:
Use descriptive language
: Employ detailed adjectives and adverbs to
paint a clear picture for Imagen.
Provide context
: If necessary, include background information to aid the
AI's understanding.
Reference specific artists or styles
: If you have a particular aesthetic
in mind, referencing specific artists or art movements can be helpful.
Use prompt engineering tools
: Consider exploring prompt engineering
tools or resources to help you refine your prompts and achieve optimal
results.
Enhancing the facial details in your personal and group images
: Specify facial details as a focus of the photo (for example, use the
    word "portrait" in the prompt).
Generate text in images
Imagen models can add text into images, opening up more creative image generation
possibilities. Use the following guidance to get the most out of this feature:
Iterate with confidence
: You might have to regenerate images until you
achieve the look you want. Imagen's text integration is still
evolving, and sometimes multiple attempts yield the best results.
Keep it short
: Limit text to 25 characters or less for optimal
generation.
Multiple phrases
: Experiment with two or three distinct phrases to
provide additional information. Avoid exceeding three phrases for cleaner
compositions.
Prompt: A poster with the text "Summerland" in bold font as a
title, underneath this text is the slogan "Summer never felt so good"
Guide Placement
: While Imagen can attempt to position text
as directed, expect occasional variations. This feature is continually
improving.
Inspire font style
: Specify a general font style to subtly influence
Imagen's choices. Don't rely on precise font replication, but expect
creative interpretations.
Font size
: Specify a font size or a general indication of size (for
example,
small
,
medium
,
large
) to influence the font size generation.
Prompt parameterization
To better control output results, you might find it helpful to parameterize the
inputs into Imagen. For example, suppose you
want your customers to be able to generate logos for their business, and you
want to make sure logos are always generated on a solid color background. You
also want to limit the options that the client can select from a menu.
In this example, you can create a parameterized prompt similar to the
following:
A
{logo_style}
logo for a
{company_area}
company on a solid color background. Include the text
{company_name}
.
In your custom user interface, the customer can input the parameters using
a menu, and their chosen value populates the prompt Imagen receives.
For example:
Prompt:
A
minimalist
logo for a
health care
company on a solid color background. Include the text
Journey
.
Prompt:
A
modern
logo for a
software
company on a solid color background. Include the text
Silo
.
Prompt:
A
traditional
logo for a
baking
company on a solid color background. Include the text
Seed
.
Advanced prompt writing techniques
Use the following examples to create more specific prompts based on attributes
like photography descriptors, shapes and materials, historical art
movements, and image quality modifiers.
Photography
Prompt includes:
"A photo of..."
To use this style, start with using keywords that clearly tell
Imagen that you're looking for a photograph. Start your prompts with
"A photo of. . ."
. For example:
Prompt:
A photo of
coffee beans in a kitchen on a wooden surface
Prompt:
A photo of
a chocolate bar on a kitchen counter
Prompt:
A photo of
a modern building with water in the background
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.
Photography modifiers
In the following examples, you can see several photography-specific modifiers
and parameters. You can combine multiple modifiers for more precise control.
Camera Proximity
-
Close up, taken from far away
Prompt: A
close-up
photo of coffee beans
Prompt: A
zoomed out
photo of a small bag of
coffee beans in a messy kitchen

Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.
Illustration and art
Prompt includes:
"A
painting
of..."
,
"A
sketch
of..."
Art styles vary from monochrome styles like pencil sketches, to hyper-realistic
digital art. For example, the following images use the same prompt with
different styles:
"An
[art style or creation technique]
of an angular
sporty electric sedan with skyscrapers in the background"
Prompt: A
technical pencil drawing
of an angular...
Prompt: A
charcoal drawing
of an angular...
Prompt: A
color pencil drawing
of an angular...
Prompt: A
pastel painting
of an angular...
Prompt: A
digital art
of an angular...
Prompt: An
art deco (poster)
of an angular...
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 2 model.
Shapes and materials
Prompt includes:
"...made of..."
,
"...in the shape of..."
One of the strengths of this technology is that you can create imagery that
is otherwise difficult or impossible. For example, you can recreate
your company logo in different materials and textures.
Prompt: a duffle bag
made of
cheese
Prompt: neon tubes
in the shape
of a bird
Prompt: an armchair
made of paper
, studio photo, origami style
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.
Historical art references
Prompt includes:
"...in the style of..."
Certain styles have become iconic over the years. The following are some ideas
of historical painting or art styles that you can try.
"generate an image in the style of
[art period or movement]
: a wind farm"
Prompt: generate an image
in the style of
an impressionist painting
: a wind farm
Prompt: generate an image
in the style of
a renaissance painting
: a wind farm
Prompt: generate an image
in the style of
pop art
: a wind farm
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.
Image quality modifiers
Certain keywords can let the model know that you're looking for a high-quality
asset. Examples of quality modifiers include the following:
General Modifiers
-
high-quality, beautiful, stylized
Photos
-
4K, HDR, Studio Photo
Art, Illustration
-
by a professional, detailed
The following are a few examples of prompts without quality modifiers and
the same prompt with quality modifiers.
Prompt (no quality modifiers): a photo of a corn stalk
Prompt (with quality modifiers):
4k HDR beautiful
photo of a corn stalk
taken by a
professional photographer
Image source: Each image was generated using its corresponding text prompt with the Imagen 3 model.
Aspect ratios
Imagen image generation lets you set five distinct image aspect
ratios.
Square
(1:1, default) - A standard square photo. Common uses for this
aspect ratio include social media posts.
Fullscreen
(4:3) - This aspect ratio is commonly used in media or film.
It is also the dimensions of most old (non-widescreen) TVs and medium format
cameras. It captures more of the scene horizontally (compared to 1:1),
making it a preferred aspect ratio for photography.
Prompt: close up of a musician's fingers
playing the piano, black and white film, vintage (4:3 aspect ratio)
Prompt: A professional studio photo of
french fries for a high end restaurant, in the style of a food magazine
     (4:3 aspect ratio)
Portrait full screen
(3:4) - This is the fullscreen aspect ratio rotated
90 degrees. This lets to capture more of the scene vertically compared to
the 1:1 aspect ratio.
Prompt: a woman hiking, close of her
boots reflected in a puddle, large mountains in the background, in the
style of an advertisement, dramatic angles (3:4 aspect ratio)
Prompt: aerial shot of a river flowing
up a mystical valley (3:4 aspect ratio)
Widescreen
(16:9) - This ratio has replaced 4:3 and is now the most
common aspect ratio for TVs, monitors, and mobile phone screens (landscape).
Use this aspect ratio when you want to capture more of the background (for
example, scenic landscapes).
Prompt: a man wearing all white
clothing sitting on the beach, close up, golden hour lighting (16:9
aspect ratio)
Portrait
(9:16) - This ratio is widescreen but rotated. This a
relatively new aspect ratio that has been popularized by short form video
apps (for example, YouTube shorts). Use this for tall objects with strong
vertical orientations such as buildings, trees, waterfalls, or other similar
objects.
Prompt: a digital render of a massive skyscraper, modern,
grand, epic with a beautiful sunset in the background (9:16 aspect ratio)
Photorealistic images
Different versions of the image generation
model might offer a mix of artistic and photorealistic output. Use the following
wording in prompts to generate more photorealistic output, based on the subject
you want to generate.
Note:
Take these keywords as general guidance when you try to create
photorealistic images. They aren't required to achieve your goal.
