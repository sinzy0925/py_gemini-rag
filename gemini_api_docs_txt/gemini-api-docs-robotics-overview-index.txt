Preview:
The Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 model is currently in preview.
Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is a vision-language model (VLM) that brings Gemini's
agentic capabilities to robotics. It's designed for advanced reasoning in the
physical world, allowing robots to interpret complex visual data, perform
spatial reasoning, and plan actions from natural language commands.
Key features and benefits:
Enhanced autonomy:
Robots can reason, adapt, and respond to changes in
open-ended environments.
Natural language interaction:
Makes robots easier to use by enabling
complex task assignments using natural language.
Task orchestration:
Deconstructs natural language commands into subtasks
and integrates with existing robot controllers and behaviors to complete
long-horizon tasks.
Versatile capabilities:
Locates and identifies objects, understands
object relationships, plans grasps and trajectories, and interprets dynamic
scenes.
This document describes
what the model does
and takes you
through several
examples
that highlight the model's
agentic capabilities.
If you want to jump right in, you can try out the model in Google AI Studio.

Safety
While Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 was built with safety in mind, it is your
responsibility to maintain a safe environment around the robot. Generative AI
models can make mistakes, and physical robots can cause damage. Safety is a
priority, and making generative AI models safe when used with real-world
robotics is an active and critical area of our research. To learn more, visit
the
Google DeepMind robotics safety page
.
Getting started: Finding objects in a scene
The following example demonstrates a common robotics use case. It shows how to
pass an image and a text prompt to the model using the
generateContent
method to get a list of identified objects with their corresponding 2D points.
The model returns points for items it identified in an image, returning
their normalized 2D coordinates and labels.
You can use this output with a robotics API or call a vision-language-action
(VLA) model or any other third-party user-defined functions to generate actions
for a robot to perform.

How it works
Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 allows your robots to contextualize and work in the
physical world using spatial understanding. It takes image/video/audio input and
natural language prompts to:
Understand objects and scene context
: Identifies objects, and reasons
about their relationship to the scene, including their affordances.
Understand task instructions
: Interprets tasks given in natural
language, like "find the banana".
Reason spatially and temporally
: Understand sequences of actions and how
objects interact with a scene over time.
Provide structured output
: Returns coordinates (points or bounding
boxes) representing object locations.
This enables robots to "see" and "understand" their environment
programmatically.
Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 is also agentic, which means it can break down complex
tasks (like "put the apple in the bowl") into sub-tasks to orchestrate long
horizon tasks:
Sequencing subtasks
: Decomposes commands into a logical sequence of
steps.
Function calls/Code execution
: Executes steps by calling your existing
robot functions/tools or executing generated code.
Read more about how function calling with Gemini works on the
Function Calling
page
.
Using the thinking budget with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5
Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 has a flexible thinking budget that gives you control
over latency versus accuracy tradeoffs. For spatial understanding tasks like
object detection, the model can achieve high performance with a small thinking
budget. More complex reasoning tasks like counting and weight estimation benefit
from a larger thinking budget. This lets you balance the need for
low-latency responses with high-accuracy results for more challenging tasks.
To learn more about thinking budgets, see the
Thinking
core capabilities page.
Agentic capabilities for robotics
This section walks through various capabilities of Gemini
Robotics-ER 1.5, demonstrating how to use the model for robotic perception,
reasoning, and planning applications.
The examples in this section demonstrate capabilities from pointing and finding
objects in an image to planning trajectories and orchestrating long horizon
tasks. For simplicity, the code snippets have been reduced to show the prompt
and the call to
generate_content
API. The full runnable code as well as
additional examples can be found in the
Robotics cookbook
.
Pointing to objects
Pointing and finding objects in images or video frames is a common use case for
vision-and-language models (VLMs) in robotics. The following example asks the
model to find specific objects within an image and return their coordinates in
an image.
Python
from
google
import
genai
from
google.genai
import
types
# Initialize the GenAI client and specify the model
MODEL_ID
=
"gemini-robotics-er-1.5-preview"
client
=
genai
.
Client
(
api_key
=
YOUR_API_KEY
)
# Load your image and set up your prompt
with
open
(
'path/to/image-with-objects.jpg'
,
'rb'
)
as
f
:
image_bytes
=
f
.
read
()
queries
=
[
"bread"
,
"starfruit"
,
"banana"
,
]
prompt
=
f
"""
Get all points matching the following objects:
{
', '
.
join
(
queries
)
}
. The
label returned should be an identifying name for the object detected.
The answer should follow the json format:
[
{{
"point":
, "label":
}}
, ...]. The points are in
[y, x] format normalized to 0-1000.
"""
image_response
=
client
.
models
.
generate_content
(
model
=
MODEL_ID
,
contents
=
[
types
.
Part
.
from_bytes
(
data

image_bytes
,
mime_type

'image/jpeg'
,
),
prompt
],
config

types
.
GenerateContentConfig
(
temperature

0.5
,
thinking_config
=
types
.
ThinkingConfig
(
thinking_budget
=
0
)
)
)
print
(
image_response
.
text
)
The output would be similar to the getting started example, a JSON containing
the coordinates of the objects found and their labels.
[
{
"point"
:
[
671
,
317
],
"label"

:
"banana"
},
{
"point"
:
[
770
,
483
],
"label"
:
"starfruit"
}
]
Use the following prompt to request the model to interpret abstract categories
like "fruit" instead of specific objects and locate all instances in the image.
Python
prompt
=
f
"""
Get all points for fruit. The label returned should be an identifying
name for the object detected.
"""
+
"""The answer should follow the json format:
[{"point": <point>, "label": <label1>}, ...]. The points are in
[y, x] format normalized to 0-1000."""

image understanding
page for
other image processing techniques.
Tracking objects in a video
Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 can also analyze video frames to track objects
over time. See
Video inputs
for a list of supported video formats.
The following is the base prompt used to find specific objects in
each frame that the model analyzes:
Python
# Define the objects to find
queries
=
[
"pen (on desk)"
,
"pen (in robot hand)"
,
"laptop (opened)"
,
"laptop (closed)"
,
]
base_prompt
=
f
"""
Point to the following objects in the provided image:
{

.
join
(

}
.
The answer should follow the json format:
[
{{
"point":

}}
, ...].
The points are in [y, x] format normalized to 0-1000.
If no objects are found, return an empty JSON list [].
"""
The output shows a pen and laptop being tracked across the video frames.
For the full runnable code, see the
Robotics cookbook
.
Object detection and bounding boxes
Beyond single points, the model can also return 2D bounding boxes, providing a
rectangular region enclosing an object.
This example requests 2D bounding boxes for identifiable objects on a table. The
model is instructed to limit the output to 25 objects and to name multiple
instances uniquely.
Python
from
google
import
genai

Trajectories
Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 can generate sequences of points that define a
trajectory, useful for guiding robot movement.
This example requests a trajectory to move a red pen to an organizer, including
the starting point and a series of intermediate points.
Python

Input image
Model output
Based on the image, here is a plan to pack the lunch box and lunch bag:

1.  **Pack the fruit into the lunch box.** Place the [apple](apple), [banana](banana), [red grapes](red grapes), and [green grapes](green grapes) into the [blue lunch box](blue lunch box).
2.  **Add the spoon to the lunch box.** Put the [blue spoon](blue spoon) inside the lunch box as well.
3.  **Close the lunch box.** Secure the lid on the [blue lunch box](blue lunch box).
4.  **Place the lunch box inside the lunch bag.** Put the closed [blue lunch box](blue lunch box) into the [brown lunch bag](brown lunch bag).
5.  **Pack the remaining items into the lunch bag.** Place the [blue snack bar](blue snack bar) and the [brown snack bar](brown snack bar) into the [brown lunch bag](brown lunch bag).

Here is the list of objects and their locations:
*   [{"point": [899, 440], "label": "apple"}]
*   [{"point": [814, 363], "label": "banana"}]
*   [{"point": [727, 470], "label": "red grapes"}]
*   [{"point": [675, 608], "label": "green grapes"}]
*   [{"point": [706, 529], "label": "blue lunch box"}]
*   [{"point": [864, 517], "label": "blue spoon"}]
*   [{"point": [499, 401], "label": "blue snack bar"}]
*   [{"point": [614, 705], "label": "brown snack bar"}]
*   [{"point": [448, 501], "label": "brown lunch bag"}]
Calling a custom robot API
This example demonstrates task orchestration with a custom robot API. It
introduces a mock API designed for a pick-and-place operation. The task is to
pick up a blue block and place it in an orange bowl:
Similar to the other examples on this page, the full runnable code is available
in the
Robotics cookbook
.
First step is to locate both of the items with the following prompt:
Python
prompt
=
"""
Locate and point to the blue block and the orange bowl. The label
returned should be an identifying name for the object detected.
The answer should follow the json format: [{"point": <point>, "label": <label1>}, ...].
The points are in [y, x] format normalized to 0-1000.
"""
The model response includes the normalized coordinates of the block and the bowl:
[

The next step is calling a sequence of API functions with the necessary logic to
execute the action. The following prompt includes a description of the robot
API that the model should use when orchestrating this task.
Python
prompt
=
f
"""
You are a robotic arm with six degrees-of-freedom. You have the
following functions available to you:
def move(x, y, high):
# moves the arm to the given coordinates. The boolean value 'high' set
to True means the robot arm should be lifted above the scene for
avoiding obstacles during motion. 'high' set to False means the robot
arm should have the gripper placed on the surface for interacting with
objects.
def setGripperState(opened):
# Opens the gripper if opened set to true, otherwise closes the gripper
def returnToOrigin():
# Returns the robot to an initial state. Should be called as a cleanup
operation.
The origin point for calculating the moves is at normalized point
y=
{
robot_origin_y
}
, x=
{
robot_origin_x
}
. Use this as the new (0,0) for
calculating moves, allowing x and y to be negative.
Perform a pick and place operation where you pick up the blue block at
normalized coordinates (
{
block_x
}
,
{
block_y
}
) (relative coordinates:
{
block_relative_x
}
,
{
block_relative_y
}
) and place it into the orange
bowl at normalized coordinates (
{
bowl_x
}
,
{
bowl_y
}
)
(relative coordinates:
{
bowl_relative_x
}
,
{
bowl_relative_y
}
).
Provide the sequence of function calls as a JSON list of objects, where
each object has a "function" key (the function name) and an "args" key
(a list of arguments for the function).
Also, include your reasoning before the JSON output.
For example:
Reasoning: To pick up the block, I will first move the arm to a high
position above the block, open the gripper, move down to the block,
close the gripper, lift the arm, move to a high position above the bowl,
move down to the bowl, open the gripper, and then lift the arm back to
a high position.
"""
The following shows a possible output of the model based on the prompt and
the mock robot API. The output includes the model thinking process and the
tasks that it planned out as a result. It also shows the output of the robot
function calls that the model sequenced together.
Reasoning: To perform the pick and place operation, I will first move the
robotic arm to a high position above the blue block to ensure clearance. Then, I
will open the gripper in preparation for grasping. Next, I will lower the arm to
the surface level to position the gripper around the block and close the gripper
to secure it. After picking up the block, I will lift the arm to clear the
surface and move towards the orange bowl, maintaining a high position to avoid
collisions. Once positioned above the bowl, I will lower the arm to place the
block inside. I will then open the gripper to release the block. Finally, I will
lift the arm out of the bowl and call `returnToOrigin` to reset the robot's
state.

Code execution
Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 can suggest and execute Python code to perform tasks that
require dynamic actions, such as zooming into an image region for better detail.
This example demonstrates how the model can suggest using the
code execution
tool to "zoom in" on a specific
area of an image, which it then carries out to answer the user's question.

The following shows a possible model response for this task. The output shows
the model generating code for zooming into the image to read the screen better.
It also shows the thought process around the adjustments it made to the
cropping. For the complete sample output, see the
Robotics
cookbook
.
# Detect relevant objects and output in json format
# [{"box_2d": [379, 407, 481, 553], "label": "display"}]
from PIL import Image

# Open the image
img = Image.open("input_file_0.jpeg")

# Define the coordinates for cropping (normalized to 0-1000)
# Based on visual inspection, the display is roughly centered around [430, 430] to [500, 500] in a 1000x1000 scale.
# Let's try to zoom in on the display area.
# Bounding box for display: [ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax] in pixels.
# From visual inspection of the original image (size 90489 bytes, resolution
unknown but let's assume a standard aspect ratio and roughly 1000x1000 for
relative positioning),
# the display is located at approximately y=380-480, x=410-540.
# Let's define a larger area around it for context.
# Let's say we want to crop from y=350 to y=550 and x=350 to x=650.

...

thought
The crop was too tight and only captured part of the display. Let's adjust the bounding box.
The previous crop was `img.crop((400, 350, 600, 500))`. This means xmin=400, ymin=350, xmax=600, ymax=500.
The display is centered around x=480, y=430.
The previous crop captured the left side of the display.
Let's expand the x range to the right and y range to cover the whole circle.
New bounding box estimate: ymin=370, xmin=400, ymax=500, xmax=600.
Let's try again with a wider crop.
# Detect relevant objects and output in json format
# [{"box_2d": [379, 407, 481, 553], "label": "display"}]
from PIL import Image

# Open the image
img = Image.open("input_file_0.jpeg")

# Define the coordinates for cropping (normalized to 0-1000)
…

The reading of 14 falls into the "Moderate" category.
The prompt asks for the "air quality reading", which can be interpreted as
either the numerical value or the categorical description. Given the numerical
value is explicitly displayed, it's the primary reading.

Let's provide the numerical value as the reading.
The reading is 014.
Based on the display on the air purifier, the air quality reading is **014**.
Best practices
To optimize the performance and accuracy of your robotics applications, it's
crucial to understand how to interact with the Gemini model effectively. This
section outlines best practices and key strategies for crafting prompts,
handling visual data, and structuring tasks to achieve the most reliable
results.
Use clear and simple language.
Embrace natural language
: The Gemini model is designed to comprehend
natural, conversational language. Structure your prompts in a way that is
semantically clear and mirrors how a person would naturally give
instructions.
Use everyday terminology
: Opt for common, everyday language over
technical or specialized jargon. If the model is not responding as
expected to a particular term, try rephrasing it with a more common
synonym.
Optimize the visual input.
Zoom in for detail
: When dealing with objects that are small or
difficult to discern in a wider shot, use a bounding box function to
isolate the object of interest. You can then crop the image to this
selection and send the new, focused image to the model for a more
detailed analysis.
Experiment with lighting and color
: The model's perception can be
affected by challenging lighting conditions and poor color contrast.
Break down complex problems into smaller steps. By addressing each smaller
step individually, you can guide the model to a more precise and successful
outcome.
Improve accuracy through consensus. For tasks that require a high degree of
precision, you can query the model multiple times with the same prompt. By
averaging the returned results, you can arrive at a "consensus" that is
often more accurate and reliable.
Limitations
Consider the following limitations when developing with Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5:
Preview status:
The model is currently in
Preview
. APIs and
capabilities may change, and it may not be suitable for production-critical
applications without thorough testing.
Latency:
Complex queries, high-resolution inputs, or extensive
thinking_budget
can lead to increased processing times.
Hallucinations:
Like all large language models, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5
can occasionally "hallucinate" or provide incorrect information, especially
for ambiguous prompts or out-of-distribution inputs.
Dependence on prompt quality:
The quality of the model's output is
highly dependent on the clarity and specificity of the input prompt. Vague
or poorly structured prompts can lead to suboptimal results.
Computational cost:
Running the model, especially with video inputs or
high
thinking_budget
, consumes computational resources and incurs costs.
See the
Thinking
page for more details.
Input types:
See the following topics for details on limitations for each mode.
